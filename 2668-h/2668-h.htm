<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
<p>There were two cousins Von der Trenck, who were barons
descended from an ancient house in East Prussia, and were
adventurous soldiers, to whom, as to the adventurous, there were
adventures that lost nothing in the telling, for they were told
by the authors&rsquo; most admiring
friends&mdash;themselves.&nbsp; Franz, the elder, was born in
1711, the son of an Austrian general; and Frederick, whose
adventures are here told, was the son of a Prussian
major-general.&nbsp; Franz, at the age of seventeen, fought
duels, and cut off the head of a man who refused to lend him
money.&nbsp; He stood six feet three inches in his shoes, knocked
down his commanding officer, was put under arrest, offered to pay
for his release by bringing in three Turks&rsquo; heads within an
hour, was released on that condition, and actually brought in
four Turks&rsquo; heads.&nbsp; When afterwards cashiered, he
settled on his estates in Croatia, and drilled a thousand of his
tenantry to act as &ldquo;Pandours&rdquo; against the
banditti.&nbsp; In 1740, he served with his Pandours under Maria
Theresa, and behaved himself as one of the more brutal sort of
banditti.&nbsp; He offered to capture Frederick of Prussia, and
did capture his tent.&nbsp; Many more of his adventures are
vaingloriously recounted by himself in the <i>M&eacute;moires du
Baron Franz de Trenck</i>, published at Paris in 1787.&nbsp; This
Trenck took poison when imprisoned at Gr&auml;tz, and died in
October, 1747, at the age of thirty-six.</p>
<p>His cousin Frederick is the Trenck who here tells a story of
himself that abounds in lively illustration of the days of
Frederick the Great.&nbsp; He professes that Frederick the King
owed him a grudge, because Frederick the Trenck had, when
eighteen years old, fascinated the Princess Amalie at a
ball.&nbsp; But as Frederick the Greater was in correspondence
with his cousin Franz at the time when that redoubtable personage
was planning the seizure of Frederick the Great, there may have
been better ground for the Trenck&rsquo;s arrest than he allows
us to imagine.&nbsp; Mr. Carlyle shows that Frederick von der
Trenck had been three months in prison, and was still in prison,
at the time of the battle of the Sohr, in which he professes to
have been engaged.&nbsp; Frederick von der Trenck, after his
release from imprisonment in 1763, married a burgomaster&rsquo;s
daughter, and went into business as a wine merchant.&nbsp; Then
he became adventurous again.&nbsp; His adventures, published in
German in 1786-7, and in his own French version in 1788, formed
one of the most popular books of its time.&nbsp; Seven plays were
founded on them, and ladies in Paris wore their bonnets &agrave;
la Trenck.&nbsp; But the French finally guillotined the author,
when within a year of threescore and ten, on the 26th of July,
1794.&nbsp; He had gone to Paris in 1792, and joined there in the
strife of parties.&nbsp; At the guillotine he struggled with the
executioner.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">H.M.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>
<p>I was born at K&ouml;nigsberg in Prussia, February 16, 1726,
of one of the most ancient families of the country.&nbsp; My
father, who was lord of Great Scharlach, Schakulack, and Meichen,
and major-general of cavalry, died in 1740, after receiving
eighteen wounds in the Prussian service.&nbsp; My mother was
daughter of the president of the high court at
K&ouml;nigsberg.&nbsp; After my father&rsquo;s death she married
Count Lostange, lieutenant-colonel in the Kiow regiment of
cuirassiers, with whom she went and resided at Breslau.&nbsp; I
had two brothers and a sister; my youngest brother was taken by
my mother into Silesia; the other was a cornet in this last-named
regiment of Kiow; and my sister was married to the only son of
the aged General Valdow.</p>
<p>My ancestors are famous in the Chronicles of the North, among
the ancient Teutonic knights, who conquered Courland, Prussia,
and Livonia.</p>
<p>By temperament I was choleric, and addicted to pleasure and
dissipation; my tutors found this last defect most difficult to
overcome; happily, they were aided by a love of knowledge
inherent in me, an emulative spirit, and a thirst for fame, which
disposition it was my father&rsquo;s care to cherish.&nbsp; A too
great consciousness of innate worth gave me a too great degree of
pride, but the endeavours of my instructor to inspire humility
were not all lost; and habitual reading, well-timed praise, and
the pleasures flowing from science, made the labours of study at
length my recreation.</p>
<p>My memory became remarkable; I am well read in the Scriptures,
the classics, and ancient history; was acquainted with geography;
could draw; learnt fencing, riding, and other necessary
exercises.</p>
<p>My religion was Lutheran; but morality was taught me by my
father, and by the worthy man to whose care he committed the
forming of my heart, whose memory I shall ever hold in
veneration.&nbsp; While a boy, I was enterprising in all the
tricks of boys, and exercised my wit in crafty excuses; the
warmth of my passions gave a satiric, biting cast to my writings,
whence it has been imagined, by those who knew but little of me,
I was a dangerous man; though, I am conscious, this was a false
judgment.</p>
<p>A soldier himself, my father would have all his sons the same;
thus, when we quarrelled, we terminated our disputes with wooden
sabres, and, brandishing these, contested by blows for victory,
while our father sat laughing, pleased at our valour and
address.&nbsp; This practice, and the praises he bestowed,
encouraged a disposition which ought to have been
counteracted.</p>
<p>Accustomed to obtain the prize, and be the hero of scholastic
contentions, I acquired the bad habit of disputation, and of
imagining myself a sage when little more than a boy.&nbsp; I
became stubborn in argument; hasty to correct others, instead of
patiently attentive: and, by presumption, continually liable to
incite enmity.&nbsp; Gentle to my inferiors, but impatient of
contradiction, and proud of resisting power, I may hence date,
the origin of all my evils.</p>
<p>How might a man, imbued with the heroic principles of liberty,
hope for advancement and happiness, under the despotic and iron
Government of Frederic?&nbsp; I was taught neither to know nor to
avoid, but to despise the whip of slavery.&nbsp; Had I learnt
hypocrisy, craft, and meanness, I had long since become
field-marshal, had been in possession of my Hungarian estates,
and had not passed the best years of my life in the dungeons of
Magdeburg.&nbsp; I was addicted to no vice: I laboured in the
cause of science, honour, and virtue; kept no vicious company;
was never in the whole of my life intoxicated; was no gamester,
no consumer of time in idleness nor brutal pleasures; but devoted
many hundred laborious nights to studies that might make me
useful to my country; yet was I punished with a severity too
cruel even for the most worthless, or most villanous.</p>
<p>I mean, in my narrative, to make candour and veracity my
guides, and not to conceal my failings; I wish my work may remain
a moral lesson to the world.&nbsp; Yet it is an innate
satisfaction that I am conscious of never having acted with
dishonour, even to the last act of this distressful tragedy.</p>
<p>I shall say little of the first years of my life, except that
my father took especial care of my education, and sent me, at the
age of thirteen, to the University of K&ouml;nigsberg, where,
under the tuition of Kowalewsky, my progress was rapid.&nbsp;
There were fourteen other noblemen in the same house, and under
the same master.</p>
<p>In the year following, 1740, I quarrelled with one young
Wallenrodt, a fellow-student, much stronger than myself, and who,
despising my weakness, thought proper to give me a blow.&nbsp; I
demanded satisfaction.&nbsp; He came not to the appointed place,
but treated my demand with contempt; and I, forgetting all
further respect, procured a second, and attacked him in open
day.&nbsp; We fought, and I had the fortune to wound him twice;
the first time in the arm, the second in the hand.</p>
<p>This affair incited inquiry:&mdash;Doctor Kowalewsky, our
tutor, laid complaints before the University, and I was condemned
to three hours&rsquo; confinement; but my grandfather and
guardian, President Derschau, was so pleased with my courage,
that he took me from this house and placed me under Professor
Christiani.</p>
<p>Here I first began to enjoy full liberty, and from this worthy
man I learnt all I know of experimental philosophy and
science.&nbsp; He loved me as his own son, and continued
instructing me till midnight.&nbsp; Under his auspices, in 1742,
I maintained, with great success, two public theses, although I
was then but sixteen; an effort and an honour till then
unknown.</p>
<p>Three days after my last public exordium, a contemptible
fellow sought a quarrel with me, and obliged me to draw in my own
defence, whom, on this occasion, I wounded in the groin.</p>
<p>This success inflated my valour, and from that time I began to
assume the air and appearance of a Hector.</p>
<p>Scarcely had a fortnight elapsed before I had another with a
lieutenant of the garrison, whom I had insulted, who received two
wounds in the contest.</p>
<p>I ought to remark, that at this time, the University of
K&ouml;nigsberg was still highly privileged.&nbsp; To send a
challenge was held honourable; and this was not only permitted,
but would have been difficult to prevent, considering the great
number of proud, hot-headed, and turbulent nobility from Livonia,
Courland, Sweden, Denmark, and Poland, who came thither to study,
and of whom there were more than five hundred.&nbsp; This brought
the University into disrepute, and endeavours have been made to
remedy the abuse.&nbsp; Men have acquired a greater extent of
true knowledge, and have begun to perceive that a University
ought to be a place of instruction, and not a field of battle;
and that blood cannot be honourably shed, except in defence of
life or country.</p>
<p>In November, 1742, the King sent his adjutant-general, Baron
Lottum, who was related to my mother, to K&ouml;nigsberg, with
whom I dined at my grandfather&rsquo;s.&nbsp; He conversed much
with me, and, after putting various questions, purposely, to
discover what my talents and inclinations were, he demanded, as
if in joke, whether I had any inclination to go with him to
Berlin, and serve my country, as my ancestors had ever done:
adding that, in the army, I should find much better opportunities
of sending challenges than at the University.&nbsp; Inflamed with
the desire of distinguishing myself, I listened with rapture to
the proposition, and in a few days we departed for Potzdam.</p>
<p>On the morrow after my arrival, I was presented to the King,
as indeed I had before been in the year 1740, with the character
of being, then, one of the most hopeful youths of the
University.&nbsp; My reception was most flattering; the justness
of my replies to the questions he asked, my height, figure, and
confidence, pleased him; and I soon obtained permission to enter
as a cadet in his body guards, with a promise of quick
preferment.</p>
<p>The body guards formed, at this time, a model and school for
the Prussian cavalry; they consisted of one single squadron of
men selected from the whole army, and their uniform was the most
splendid in all Europe.&nbsp; Two thousand rix-dollars were
necessary to equip an officer: the cuirass was wholly plated with
silver; and the horse, furniture, and accoutrements alone cost
four hundred rix-dollars.</p>
<p>This squadron only contained six officers and a hundred and
forty-four men; but there were always fifty or sixty
supernumeraries, and as many horses, for the King incorporated
all the most handsome men he found in the guards.&nbsp; The
officers were the best taught of any the army contained; the King
himself was their tutor, and he afterwards sent them to instruct
the cavalry in the manoeuvres they had learnt.&nbsp; Their rise
was rapid if they behaved well; but they were broken for the
least fault, and punished by being sent to garrison
regiments.&nbsp; It was likewise necessary they should be
tolerably rich, as well as possess such talents as might be
successfully employed, both at court and in the army.</p>
<p>There are no soldiers in the world who undergo so much as this
body guard; and during the time I was in the service of Frederic,
I often had not eight hours&rsquo; sleep in eight days.&nbsp;
Exercise began at four in the morning, and experiments were made
of all the alterations the King meant to introduce in his
cavalry.&nbsp; Ditches of three, four, five, six feet, and still
wider, were leaped, till that someone broke his neck; hedges, in
like manner, were freed, and the horses ran careers, meeting each
other full speed in a kind of lists of more than half a league in
length.&nbsp; We had often, in these our exercises, several men
and horses killed or wounded.</p>
<p>It happened more frequently than otherwise that the same
experiments were repeated after dinner with fresh horses; and it
was not uncommon, at Potzdam, to hear the alarm sounded twice in
a night.&nbsp; The horses stood in the King&rsquo;s stables; and
whoever had not dressed, armed himself, saddled his horse,
mounted, and appeared before the palace in eight minutes, was put
under arrest for fourteen days.</p>
<p>Scarcely were the eyes closed before the trumpet again
sounded, to accustom youth to vigilance.&nbsp; I lost, in one
year, three horses, which had either broken their legs, in
leaping ditches, or died of fatigue.</p>
<p>I cannot give a stronger picture of this service than by
saying that the body guard lost more men and horses in one
year&rsquo;s peace than they did, during the following year, in
two battles.</p>
<p>We had, at this time, three stations; our service, in the
winter, was at Berlin, where we attended the opera, and all
public festivals: in the spring we were exercised at
Charlottenberg; and at Potzdam, or wherever the King went, during
the summer.&nbsp; The six officers of the guard dined with the
King, and, on gala days, with the Queen.&nbsp; It may be presumed
there was not at that time on earth a better school to form an
officer and a man of the world than was the court of Berlin.</p>
<p>I had scarcely been six weeks a cadet before the King took me
aside, one day, after the parade, and having examined me near
half an hour, on various subjects, commanded me to come and speak
to him on the morrow.</p>
<p>His intention was to find whether the accounts that had been
given him of my memory had not been exaggerated; and that he
might be convinced, he first gave me the names of fifty soldiers
to learn by rote, which I did in five minutes.&nbsp; He next
repeated the subjects of two letters, which I immediately
composed in French and Latin; the one I wrote, the other I
dictated.&nbsp; He afterwards ordered me to trace, with
promptitude, a landscape from nature, which I executed with equal
success; and he then gave me a cornet&rsquo;s commission in his
body guards.</p>
<p>Each mark of bounty from the monarch increased an ardour
already great, inspired me with gratitude, and the first of my
wishes was to devote my whole life to the service of my King and
country.&nbsp; He spoke to me as a Sovereign should speak, like a
father, like one who knew well how to estimate the gifts bestowed
on me by nature; and perceiving, or rather feeling, how much he
might expect from me, became at once my instructor and my
friend.</p>
<p>Thus did I remain a cadet only six weeks, and few Prussians
can vaunt, under the reign of Frederic, of equal good
fortune.</p>
<p>The King not only presented me with a commission, but equipped
me splendidly for the service.&nbsp; Thus did I suddenly find
myself a courtier, and an officer in the finest, bravest, and
best disciplined corps in Europe.&nbsp; My good fortune seemed
unlimited, when, in the month of August, 1743, the King selected
me to go and instruct the Silesian cavalry in the new manoeuvres:
an honour never before granted to a youth of eighteen.</p>
<p>I have already said we were garrisoned at Berlin during
winter, where the officers&rsquo; table was at court: and, as my
reputation had preceded me, no person whatever could be better
received there, or live more pleasantly.</p>
<p>Frederic commanded me to visit the literati, whom he had
invited to his court: Maupertuis, Jordan, La Mettrie, and
Pollnitz, were all my acquaintance.&nbsp; My days were employed
in the duties of an officer, and my nights in acquiring
knowledge.&nbsp; Pollnitz was my guide, and the friend of my
heart.&nbsp; My happiness was well worthy of being envied.&nbsp;
In 1743, I was five feet eleven inches in height, and Nature had
endowed me with every requisite to please.&nbsp; I lived, as I
vainly imagined, without inciting enmity or malice, and my mind
was wholly occupied by the desire of earning well-founded
fame.</p>
<p>I had hitherto remained ignorant of love, and had been
terrified from illicit commerce by beholding the dreadful objects
of the hospital at Potzdam.&nbsp; During the winter of 1743, the
nuptials of his Majesty&rsquo;s sister were celebrated, who was
married to the King of Sweden, where she is at present Queen
Dowager, mother of the reigning Gustavus.&nbsp; I, as officer of
my corps, had the honour to mount guard and escort her as far as
Stettin.&nbsp; Here first did my heart feel a passion of which,
in the course of my history, I shall have frequent occasion to
speak.&nbsp; The object of my love was one whom I can only
remember at present with reverence; and, as I write not romance,
but facts, I shall here briefly say, ours were mutually the
first-fruits of affection, and that to this hour I regret no
misfortune, no misery, with which, from a stock so noble, my
destiny was overshadowed.</p>
<p>Amid the tumult inseparable to occasions like these, on which
it was my duty to maintain order, a thief had the address to
steal my watch, and cut away part of the gold fringe which hung
from the waistcoat of my uniform, and afterwards to escape
unperceived.&nbsp; This accident brought on me the raillery of my
comrades; and the lady alluded to thence took occasion to console
me, by saying it should be her care that I should be no
loser.&nbsp; Her words were accompanied by a look I could not
misunderstand, and a few days after I thought myself the happiest
of mortals.&nbsp; The name, however, of this high-born lady is a
secret, which must descend with me to the grave; and, though my
silence concerning this incident heaves a void in my life, and
indeed throws obscurity over a part of it, which might else be
clear, I would much rather incur this reproach than become
ungrateful towards my best friend and benefactress.&nbsp; To her
conversation, to her prudence, to the power by which she fixed my
affections wholly on herself, am I indebted for the improvement
and polishing of my bodily and mental qualities.&nbsp; She never
despised, betrayed, or abandoned me, even in the deepest of my
distress; and my children alone, on my death-bed, shall be taught
the name of her to whom they owe the preservation of their
father, and consequently their own existence.</p>
<p>I lived at this time perfectly happy at Berlin, and highly
esteemed.&nbsp; The King took every opportunity to testify his
approbation; my mistress supplied me with more money than I could
expend; and I was presently the best equipped, and made the
greatest figure, of any officer in the whole corps.&nbsp; The
style in which I lived was remarked, for I had only received from
my father&rsquo;s heritage the estate of Great Scharlach; the
rent of which was eight hundred dollars a year, which was far
from sufficient to supply my then expenses.&nbsp; My amour, in
the meantime, remained a secret from my best and most intimate
friends.&nbsp; Twice was my absence from Potzdam and
Charlottenberg discovered, and I was put under arrest; but the
King seemed satisfied with the excuse I made, under the pretext
of having been hunting, and smiled as he granted my pardon.</p>
<p>Never did the days of youth glide away with more apparent
success and pleasure than during these my first years at
Berlin.&nbsp; This good fortune was, alas, of short
duration.&nbsp; Many are the incidents I might relate, but which
I shall omit.&nbsp; My other adventures are sufficiently
numerous, without mingling such as may any way seem foreign to
the subject.&nbsp; In this gloomy history of my life, I wish to
paint myself such as I am; and, by the recital of my sufferings,
afford a memorable example to the world, and interest the heart
of sensibility.&nbsp; I would also show how my fatal destiny has
deprived my children of an immense fortune; and, though I want a
hundred thousand men to enforce and ensure my rights, I will
leave demonstration to my heirs that they are incontestable.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>
<p>In the beginning of September, 1744, war again broke out
between the Houses of Austria and Prussia.&nbsp; We marched with
all speed towards Prague, traversing Saxony without
opposition.&nbsp; I will not relate in this place what the great
Frederic said to us, with evident emotion, when surrounded by all
his officers, on the morning of our departure from Potzdam.</p>
<p>Should any one be desirous of writing the lives of him and his
opponent, Maria Theresa, without flattery and without fear, let
him apply to me, and I will relate anecdotes most surprising on
this subject, unknown to all but myself, and which never must
appear under my own name.</p>
<p>All monarchs going to war have reason on their side; and the
churches of both parties resound with prayers, and appeals to
Divine Justice, for the success of their arms.&nbsp; Frederic, on
this occasion, had recourse to them with regret, of which I was a
witness.</p>
<p>If I am not mistaken, the King&rsquo;s army came before Prague
on the 14th of September, and that of General Schwerin, which had
passed through Silesia, arrived the next day on the other side of
the Moldau.&nbsp; In this position we were obliged to wait some
days for pontoons, without which we could not establish a
communication between the two armies.</p>
<p>The height called Zischka, which overlooks the city, being
guarded only by a few Croats, was instantly seized, without
opposition, by some grenadiers, and the batteries, erected at the
foot of that mountain, being ready on the fifth day, played with
such success on the old town with bombs and red-hot balls that it
was set on fire.&nbsp; The King made every effort to take the
city before Prince Charles could bring his army from the Rhine to
its relief.</p>
<p>General Harsh thought proper to capitulate, after a siege of
twelve days, during which not more than five hundred men of the
garrison, at the utmost, were killed and wounded, though eighteen
thousand men were made prisoners.</p>
<p>Thus far we had met with no impediment.&nbsp; The Imperial
army, however, under the command of Prince Charles of Lorraine,
having quitted the banks of the Rhine, was advancing to save
Bohemia.</p>
<p>During this campaign we saw the enemy only at a distance; but
the Austrian light troops being thrice as numerous as ours,
prevented us from all foraging.&nbsp; Winter was approaching,
dearth and hunger made Frederic determine to retreat, without the
least hope from the countries in our rear, which we had entirely
laid waste as we had advanced.&nbsp; The severity of the season,
in the month of November, rendered the soldiers excessively
impatient of their hardships; and, accustomed to conquer, the
Prussians were ashamed of and repined at retreat: the
enemy&rsquo;s light troops facilitated desertion, and we lost, in
a few weeks, above thirty thousand men.&nbsp; The pandours of my
kinsman, the Austrian Trenck, were incessantly at our heels, gave
us frequent alarms, did us great injury, and, by their alertness,
we never could make any impression upon them with our
cannon.&nbsp; Trenck at length passed the Elbe, and went and
burnt and destroyed our magazines at Pardubitz: it was therefore
resolved wholly to evacuate Bohemia.</p>
<p>The King hoped to have brought Prince Charles to the battle
between Benneschan and Kannupitz, but in vain: the Saxons, during
the night, had entered a battery of three-and-twenty cannon on a
mound which separated two ponds: this was the precise road by
which the King meant to make the attack.</p>
<p>Thus were we obliged to abandon Bohemia.&nbsp; The dearth,
both for man and horse, began to grow extreme.&nbsp; The weather
was bad; the roads and ruts were deep; marches were continual,
and alarms and attacks from the enemy&rsquo;s light troops became
incessant.&nbsp; The discontent all these inspired was universal,
and this occasioned the great loss of the army.</p>
<p>Under such circumstances, had Prince Charles continued to
harass us, by persuading us into Silesia, had he made a winter
campaign, instead of remaining indolently at ease in Bohemia, we
certainly should not have vanquished him, the year following, at
Strigau; but he only followed at a distance, as far as the
Bohemian frontiers.&nbsp; This gave Frederic time to recover, and
the more effectually because the Austrians had the imprudence to
permit the return of deserters.</p>
<p>This was a repetition of what had happened to Charles XII.
when he suffered his Russian prisoners to return home, who
afterwards so effectually punished his contempt of them at the
battle of Pultawa.</p>
<p>Prague was obliged to be abandoned, with considerable loss;
and Trenck seized on Tabor, Budweis, and Frauenberg, where he
took prisoners the regiments of Walrabe Kreutz.</p>
<p>No one would have been better able to give a faithful history
of this campaign than myself, had I room in this place, and had I
at that time been more attentive to things of moment; since I not
only performed the office of adjutant to the King, when he went
to reconnoitre, or choose a place of encampment, but it was,
moreover, my duty to provide forage for the headquarters.&nbsp;
The King having only permitted me to take six volunteers from the
body guard, to execute this latter duty, I was obliged to add to
them horse chasseurs, and hussars, with whom I was continually in
motion.&nbsp; I was peculiarly fortunate on two occasions, by
happening to come after the enemy when they had left loaded
waggons and forage bundles.</p>
<p>I seldom passed the night in my tent during this campaign, and
my indefatigable activity obtained the favour and entire
confidence of Frederic.&nbsp; Nothing so much contributed to
inspire me with emulation as the public praises I received, and
my enthusiasm wished to perform wonders.&nbsp; The campaign,
however, but ill supplied me with opportunities to display my
youthful ardour.</p>
<p>At length no one durst leave the camp, notwithstanding the
extremity of the dearth, because of the innumerable clouds of
pandours and hussars that hovered everywhere around.</p>
<p>No sooner were we arrived in Silesia, than the King&rsquo;s
body guard were sent to Berlin, there to remain in winter
quarters.</p>
<p>I should not here have mentioned the Bohemian war, but that,
while writing time history of my life, I ought not to omit
accidents by which my future destiny was influenced.</p>
<p>One day, while at Bennaschen, I was commanded out, with a
detachment of thirty hussars and twenty chasseurs, on a foraging
party.&nbsp; I had posted my hussars in a convent, and gone
myself, with the chasseurs, to a mansion-house, to seize the
carts necessary for the conveyance of the hay and straw from a
neighbouring farm.&nbsp; An Austrian lieutenant of hussars,
concealed with thirty-six horsemen in a wood, having remarked the
weakness of my escort, taking advantage of the moment when my
people were all employed in loading the carts, first seized our
sentinel, and then fell suddenly upon them, and took them all
prisoners in the very farm-yard.&nbsp; At this moment I was
seated at my ease, beside the lady of the mansion-house, and was
a spectator of the whole transaction through the window.</p>
<p>I was ashamed of and in despair at my negligence.&nbsp; The
kind lady wished to hide me when the firing was heard in the
farm-yard.&nbsp; By good fortune, the hussars, whom I had
stationed in the convent, had learnt from a peasant that there
was an Austrian detachment in the wood: they had seen us at a
distance enter the farmyard, hastily marched to our aid, and we
had not been taken more than two minutes before they
arrived.&nbsp; I cannot express the pleasure with which I put
myself at their head.&nbsp; Some of the enemy&rsquo;s party
escaped through a back door, but we made two-and-twenty
prisoners, with a lieutenant of the regiment of
Kalnockichen.&nbsp; They had two men killed, and one wounded; and
two also of my chasseurs were hewn down by the sabre, in the
hay-loft, where they were at work.</p>
<p>We continued our forage with more caution after this accident:
the horses we had taken served, in part, to draw the carts; and,
after raising a contribution of one hundred and fifty ducats on
the convent, which I distributed among the soldiers to engage
them to silence, we returned to the army, from which we were
distant about two leagues.</p>
<p>We heard firing as we marched, and the foragers on all sides
were skirmishing with the enemy.&nbsp; A lieutenant and forty
horse joined me; yet, with this reinforcement, I durst not return
to the camp, because I learned we were in danger from more than
eight hundred pandours and hussars, who were in the plain.&nbsp;
I therefore determined to take a long, winding, but secret route,
and had the good fortune to come safe to quarters with my
prisoners and five-and-twenty loaded carts.&nbsp; The King was at
dinner when I entered his tent.&nbsp; Having been absent all
night, it was imagined I had been taken, that accident having
happened the same day to many others.</p>
<p>The instant I entered, the King demanded if I returned
singly.&nbsp; &ldquo;No, please your Majesty,&rdquo; answered I;
&ldquo;I have brought five-and-twenty loads of forage, and
two-and-twenty prisoners, with their officer and
horses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The King then commanded me to sit down, and turning himself
towards the English ambassador, who was near him, said, laying
his hand on my shoulder, &ldquo;<i>C&rsquo;est un Matador de ma
jeunesse</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A reconnoitring party was, at the same moment, in waiting
before his tent: he consequently asked me few questions, and to
those he did ask, I replied trembling.&nbsp; In a few minutes he
rose from the table, gave a glance at the prisoners, hung the
Order of Merit round my neck, commanded me to go and take repose,
and set off with his party.</p>
<p>It is easy to conceive the embarrassment of my situation; my
unpardonable negligence deserved that I should have been broken,
instead of which I was rewarded; an instance, this, of the great
influence of chance on the affairs of the world.&nbsp; How many
generals have gained victories by their very errors, which have
been afterwards attributed to their genius! It is evident the
sergeant of hussars, who retook me and my men by bringing up his
party, was much better entitled than myself to the recompense I
received.&nbsp; On many occasions have I since met with disgrace
and punishment when I deserved reward.&nbsp; My inquietude lest
the truth should be discovered, was extreme, especially
recollecting how many people were in the secret: and my
apprehensions were incessant.</p>
<p>As I did not want money, I gave the sergeants twenty ducats
each, and the soldiers one, in order to insure their silence,
which, being a favourite with them, they readily promised.&nbsp;
I, however, was determined to declare the truth the very first
opportunity, and this happened a few days after.</p>
<p>We were on our march, and I, as cornet, was at the head of my
company, when the King, advancing, beckoned me to come to him,
and bade me tell him exactly how the affair I had so lately been
engaged in happened.</p>
<p>The question at first made me mistrust I was betrayed, but
remarking the King had a mildness in his manner, I presently
recovered myself, and related the exact truth.&nbsp; I saw the
astonishment of his countenance, but I at the same time saw he
was pleased with my sincerity.&nbsp; He spoke to me for half an
hour, not as a King, but as a father, praised my candour, and
ended with the following words, which, while life remains, I
shall never forget: &ldquo;Confide in the advice I give you;
depend wholly upon me, and I will make you a man.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Whoever can feel, may imagine how infinitely my gratitude towards
the King was increased, by this his great goodness; from that
moment I had no other desire than to live and die for his
service.</p>
<p>I soon perceived the confidence the King had in me after this
explanation, of which I received very frequent marks, the
following winter, at Berlin.&nbsp; He permitted me to be present
at his conversations with the literati of his court, and my state
was truly enviable.</p>
<p>I received this same winter more than five hundred ducats as
presents.&nbsp; So much happiness could not but excite jealousy,
and this began to be manifest on every side.&nbsp; I had too
little disguise for a courtier, and my heart was much too open
and frank.</p>
<p>Before I proceed, I will here relate an incident which
happened during the last campaign, and which will, no doubt, be
read in the history of Frederic.</p>
<p>On the rout while retreating through Bohemia, the King came to
Kollin, with his horse-guards, the cavalry piquets of the
head-quarters, and the second and third battalions of
guards.&nbsp; We had only four field pieces, and our squadron was
stationed in one of the suburbs.&nbsp; Our advance posts, towards
evening, were driven back into the town, and the hussars entered
pell-mell: the enemy&rsquo;s light troops swarmed over the
country, and my commanding officer sent me immediately to receive
the King&rsquo;s orders.&nbsp; After much search, I found him at
the top of a steeple, with a telescope in his hand.&nbsp; Never
did I see him so disturbed or undecided as on this
occasion.&nbsp; Orders were immediately given that we should
retreat through the city, into the opposite suburb, where we were
to halt, but not unsaddle.</p>
<p>We had not been here long before a most heavy rain fell, and
the night became exceedingly dark.&nbsp; My cousin Trenck made
his approach about nine in the evening, with his pandour and
janissary music, and set fire to several houses.&nbsp; They found
we were in the suburb, and began to fire upon us from the city
windows.&nbsp; The tumult became extreme: the city was too full
for us to re-enter: the gate was shut, and they fired from above
at us with our field-pieces.&nbsp; Trenck had let in the waters
upon us, and we were up to the girths by midnight, and almost in
despair.&nbsp; We lost seven men, and my horse was wounded in the
neck.</p>
<p>The King, and all of us, had certainly been made prisoners had
my cousin, as he has since told me, been able to continue the
assault he had begun: but a cannon ball having wounded him in the
foot, he was carried off, and the pandours retired.&nbsp; The
corps of Nassau arrived next day to our aid; we quitted Kollin,
and during the march the King said to me, &ldquo;Your cousin had
nearly played us a malicious prank last night, but the deserters
say he is killed.&rdquo;&nbsp; He then asked what our
relationship was, and there our conversation ended.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>
<p>It was about the middle of December when we came to Berlin,
where I was received with open arms.&nbsp; I became less cautious
than formerly, and, perhaps, more narrowly observed.&nbsp; A
lieutenant of the foot guards, who was a public Ganymede, and
against whom I had that natural antipathy and abhorrence I have
for all such wretches, having indulged himself in some very
impertinent jokes on the secret of my amour, I bestowed on him
the epithet he deserved: we drew our swords, and he was
wounded.&nbsp; On the Sunday following I presented myself to pay
my respects to his Majesty on the parade, who said to me as he
passed, &ldquo;The storm and the thunder shall rend your heart;
beware!&rdquo; <a name="citation1"></a><a href="#footnote1"
class="citation">[1]</a>&nbsp; He added nothing more.</p>
<p>Some little time after I was a few minutes too late on the
parade; the King remarked it, and sent me, under arrest, to the
foot-guard at Potzdam.&nbsp; When I had been here a fortnight,
Colonel Wartensleben came, and advised me to petition for
pardon.&nbsp; I was then too much a novice in the modes of the
court to follow his counsel, nor did I even remark the person who
gave it me was himself a most subtle courtier.&nbsp; I complained
bitterly that I had so long been deprived of liberty, for a fault
which was usually punished by three, or, at most, six days&rsquo;
arrest.&nbsp; Here accordingly I remained.</p>
<p>Eight days after, the King being come to Potzdam, I was sent
by General Bourke to Berlin, to carry some letters, but without
having seen the King.&nbsp; On my return I presented myself to
him on the parade; and as our squadron was garrisoned at Berlin,
I asked, &ldquo;Does it please your Majesty that I should go and
join my corps?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Whence came you?&rdquo;
answered he.&nbsp; &ldquo;From Berlin.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;And
where were you before you went to Berlin?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Under arrest.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Then under arrest you
must remain!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I did not recover my liberty till three days before our
departure for Silesia, towards which we marched, with the utmost
speed, in the beginning of May, to commence our second
campaign.</p>
<p>Here I must recount an event which happened that winter, which
became the source of all my misfortunes, and to which I must
entreat my readers will pay the utmost attention; since this
error, if innocence can be error, was the cause that the most
faithful and the best of subjects became bewildered in scenes of
wretchedness, and was the victim of misery, from his nineteenth
to the sixtieth year of his age.&nbsp; I dare presume that this
true narrative, supported by testimonies the most authentic, will
fully vindicate my present honour and my future memory.</p>
<p>Francis, Baron of Trenck, was the son of my father&rsquo;s
brother, consequently my cousin german.&nbsp; I shall speak,
hereafter, of the singular events of his life.&nbsp; Being a
commander of pandours in the Austrian service, and grievously
wounded at Bavaria, in the year 1743, he wrote to my mother,
informing her he intended me, her eldest son, for his universal
legatee.&nbsp; This letter, to which I returned no answer, was
sent to me at Potzdam.&nbsp; I was so satisfied with my
situation, and had such numerous reasons so to be, considering
the kindness with which the King treated me, that I would not
have exchanged my good fortune for all the treasures of the Great
Mogul.</p>
<p>On the 12th of February, 1744, being at Berlin, I was in
company with Captain Jaschinsky, commander of the body guard, the
captain of which ranks as colonel in the army, together with
Lieutenant Studnitz, and Cornet Wagnitz.&nbsp; The latter was my
field comrade, and is at present commander-general of the cavalry
of Hesse Cassel.&nbsp; The Austrian Trenck became the subject of
conversation, and Jaschinsky asked if I were his kinsman.&nbsp; I
answered, yes, and immediately mentioned his having made me his
universal heir.&nbsp; &ldquo;And what answer have you
returned?&rdquo; said Jaschinsky.&mdash;&ldquo;None at
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The whole company then observed that, in a case like the
present, I was much to blame not to answer; that the least I
could do would be to thank him for his good wishes, and entreat a
continuance of them.&nbsp; Jaschinsky further added,
&ldquo;Desire him to send you some of his fine Hungarian horses
for your own use, and give me the letter; I will convey it to
him, by means of Mr. Bossart, legation counsellor of the Saxon
embassy; but on condition that you will give me one of the
horses.&nbsp; This correspondence is a family, and not a state
affair; I will make myself responsible for the
consequences.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I immediately took my commander&rsquo;s advice, and began to
write; and had those who suspected me thought proper to make the
least inquiry into these circumstances, the four witnesses who
read what I wrote could have attested my innocence, and rendered
it indubitable.&nbsp; I gave my letter open to Jaschinsky, who
sealed and sent it himself.</p>
<p>I must omit none of the incidents concerning this letter, it
being the sole cause of all my sufferings.&nbsp; I shall
therefore here relate an event which was the first occasion of
the unjust suspicions entertained against me.</p>
<p>One of my grooms, with two led horses, was, among many others,
taken by the pandours of Trenck.&nbsp; When I returned to the
camp, I was to accompany the King on a reconnoitring party.&nbsp;
My horse was too tired, and I had no other: I informed him of my
embarrassment, and his Majesty immediately made me a present of a
fine English courser.</p>
<p>Some days after, I was exceedingly astonished to see my groom
return, with my two horses, and a pandour trumpeter, who brought
me a letter, containing nearly the following words:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Austrian Trenck is not at war with the Prussian
Trenck, but, on the contrary, is happy to have recovered his
horses from his hussars, and to return them to whom they first
belonged,&rdquo; &amp;c.</p>
<p>I went the same day to pay my respects to the King, who,
receiving me with great coldness, said, &ldquo;Since your cousin
has returned your own horses, you have no more need of
mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were too many who envied me to suppose these words would
escape repetition.&nbsp; The return of the horses seems
infinitely to have increased that suspicion Frederic entertained
against me, and therefore became one of the principal causes of
my misfortunes: it is for this reason that I dwell upon this and
suchlike small incidents, they being necessary for my own
justification, and, were it possible, for that of the King.&nbsp;
My innocence is, indeed, at present universally acknowledged by
the court, the army, and the whole nation; who all mention the
injustice I suffered with pity, and the fortitude with which it
was endured with surprise.</p>
<p>We marched for Silesia, to enter on our second campaign:
which, to the Prussians, was as bloody and murderous as it was
glorious.</p>
<p>The King&rsquo;s head-quarters were fixed at the convent of
Kamentz, where we rested fourteen days, and the army remained in
cantonments.&nbsp; Prince Charles, instead of following us into
Bohemia, had the imprudence to occupy the plain of Strigau, and
we already concluded his army was beaten.&nbsp; Whoever is well
acquainted with tactics, and the Prussian manoeuvres, will easily
judge, without the aid of calculation or witchcraft, whether a
well or ill-disciplined army, in an open plain, ought to be
victorious.</p>
<p>The army hastily left its cantonments, and in twenty-four
hours was in order of battle; and on the 14th of June, eighteen
thousand bodies lay stretched on the plain of Strigau.&nbsp; The
allied armies of Austria and Saxony were totally defeated.</p>
<p>The body guard was on the right; and previous to the attack,
the King said to our squadron, &ldquo;Prove today, my children,
that you are my body guard, and give no Saxon quarter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We made three attacks on the cavalry, and two on the
infantry.&nbsp; Nothing could withstand a squadron like this,
which for men, horses, courage, and experience, was assuredly the
first in the world.&nbsp; Our corps alone took seven standards
and five pairs of colours, and in less than an hour the affair
was over.</p>
<p>I received a pistol shot in my right hand, my horse was
desperately wounded, and I was obliged to change him on the third
charge.&nbsp; The day after the battle all the officers were
rewarded with the Order of Merit.&nbsp; For my own part, I
remained four weeks among the wounded, at Schweidnitz, where
there were sixteen thousand men under the torture of the army
surgeons, many of whom had not their wounds dressed till the
third day.</p>
<p>I was near three months before I recovered the use of my hand:
I nevertheless rejoined my corps, continued to perform my duty,
and as usual accompanied the King when he went to
reconnoitre.&nbsp; For some time past he had placed confidence in
me, and his kindness towards me continually increased, which
raised my gratitude even to enthusiasm.</p>
<p>I also performed the service of adjutant during this campaign,
a circumstantial account of which no person is better enabled to
write than myself, I having been present at all that
passed.&nbsp; I was the scholar of the greatest master the art of
war ever knew, and who believed me worthy to receive his
instructions; but the volume I am writing would be insufficient
to contain all that personally relates to myself.</p>
<p>I must here mention an adventure that happened at this time,
and which will show the art of the great Frederic in forming
youth for his service, and devotedly attaching them to his
person.</p>
<p>I was exceedingly fond of hunting, in which, notwithstanding
it was severely forbidden, I indulged myself.&nbsp; I one day
returned, laden with pheasants; but judge my astonishment and
fears when I saw the army had decamped, and that it was with
difficulty that I could overtake the rear-guard.</p>
<p>In this my distress, I applied to an officer of hussars, who
instantly lent me his horse, by the aid of which I rejoined my
corps, which always marched as the vanguard.&nbsp; Mounting my
own horse, I tremblingly rode to the head of my division, which
it was my duty to precede.&nbsp; The King, however, had remarked
my absence, or rather had been reminded of it by my superior
officer, who, for some time past, had become my enemy.</p>
<p>Just as the army halted to encamp, the King rode towards me,
and made a signal for me to approach, and, seeing my fears in my
countenance, said, &ldquo;What, are you just returned from
hunting?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, your Majesty.&nbsp; I
hope&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; Here interrupting me, he added,
&ldquo;Well, well, for this time, I shall take no further notice,
remembering Potzdam; but, however, let me find you more attentive
to your duty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So ended this affair, for which I deserved to have been
broken.&nbsp; I must remind my readers that the King meant by the
words remembering Potzdam, he remembered I had been punished too
severely the winter before, and that my present pardon was
intended as a compensation.</p>
<p>This was indeed to think and act greatly; this was indeed the
true art of forming great men: an art much more effectual than
that of ferocious generals, who threaten subalterns with
imprisonment and chains on every slight occasion; and, while
indulging all the rigours of military law, make no distinction of
minds or of men.&nbsp; Frederic, on the contrary, sometimes
pardoned the failings of genius, while mechanic souls he
mechanically punished, according to the very letter of the laws
of war.</p>
<p>I shall further remark, the King took no more notice of my
late fault, except that sometimes, when I had the honour to dine
with him, he would ridicule people who were too often at the
chase, or who were so choleric that they took occasion to quarrel
for the least trifle.</p>
<p>The campaign passed in different manoeuvres, marches, and
countermarches.&nbsp; Our corps was the most fatigued, as being
encamped round the King&rsquo;s tent, the station of which was
central, and as likewise having the care of the vanguard; we were
therefore obliged to begin our march two hours sooner than the
remainder of the army, that we might be in our place.&nbsp; We
also accompanied the King whenever he went to reconnoitre, traced
the lines of encampment, led the horse to water, inspected the
head-quarters, and regulated the march and encampment, according
to the King&rsquo;s orders; the performance of all which robbed
us of much rest, we being but six officers to execute so many
different functions.</p>
<p>Still further, we often executed the office of couriers, to
bear the royal commands to detachments.&nbsp; The King was
particularly careful that the officers of his guards, whom he
intended should become excellent in the art of tactics, should
not be idle in his school.&nbsp; It was necessary to do much in
order that much might be learnt.&nbsp; Labour, vigilance,
activity, the love of glory and the love of his country, animated
all his generals; into whom, it may be said, he infused his
spirit.</p>
<p>In this school I gained instruction, and here already was I
selected as one designed to instruct others; yet, in my fortieth
year, a great general at Vienna told me, &ldquo;My dear Trenck,
our discipline would be too difficult for you to learn; for
which, indeed, you are too far advanced in life.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Agreeable to this wise decision was I made an Austrian invalid,
and an invalid have always remained; a judgment like this would
have been laughed at, most certainly, at Berlin.</p>
<p>If I mistake not, the famous battle of Soor, or Sorau, was
fought on the 14th day of September.&nbsp; The King had sent so
many detachments into Saxony, Bohemia, and Silesia, that the main
army did not consist of more than twenty-five thousand men.&nbsp;
Neglecting advice, and obstinate in judging his enemy by numbers,
and not according to the excellence of discipline, and other
accidents, Prince Charles, blind to the real strength of the
Prussian armies, had enclosed this small number of Pomeranian and
Brandenburg regiments, with more than eighty-six thousand men,
intending to take them all prisoners.</p>
<p>It will soon be seen from my narrative with what kind of
secrecy his plan was laid and executed.</p>
<p>The King came into my tent about midnight; as he also did into
that of all the officers, to awaken them; his orders were,
&ldquo;Secretly to saddle, leave the baggage in the rear, and
that the men should stand ready to mount at the word of
command.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lieutenant Studnitz and myself attended the King, who went in
person, and gave directions through the whole army; meantime,
break of day was expected with anxiety.</p>
<p>Opposite the defile through which the enemy was to march to
the attack eight field-pieces were concealed behind a hill.&nbsp;
The King must necessarily have been informed of the whole plan of
the Austrian general, for he had called in the advanced posts
from the heights, that he might lull him into security, and make
him imagine we should be surprised in the midst of sleep.</p>
<p>Scarcely did break of day appear before the Austrian
artillery, situated upon the heights, began to play upon our
camp, and their cavalry to march through the defile to the
attack.</p>
<p>As suddenly were we in battle array; for in less than ten
minutes we ourselves began the attack, notwithstanding the
smallness of our number, the whole army only containing five
regiments of cavalry.&nbsp; We fell with such fury upon the enemy
(who at this time were wholly employed in forming their men at
the mouth of the defile, and that slowly, little expecting so
sudden and violent a charge), that we drove them back into the
defile, where they pressed upon each other in crowds; the King
himself stood ready to unmask his eight field-pieces, and a
dreadful and bloody slaughter ensued in this narrow place; from
which the enemy had not the power to retreat.&nbsp; This single
incident gained the battle, and deceived all time hopes of Prince
Charles.</p>
<p>Nadasti, Trenck, and the light troops, sent to attack our
rear, were employed in pillaging the camp.&nbsp; The ferocious
Croats met no opposition, while this their error made our victory
more secure.&nbsp; It deserves to be noticed that, when advice
was brought to the King that the enemy had fallen upon and were
plundering the camp, his answer was, &ldquo;So much the better;
they have found themselves employment, and will be no impediment
to our main design.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our victory was complete, but all our baggage was lost; the
headquarters, utterly undefended, were totally stripped; and
Trenck had, for his part of the booty, the King&rsquo;s tent and
his service of plate.</p>
<p>I have mentioned this circumstance here, because that, in the
year 1740, my cousin Trenck, having fallen into the power of his
enemies, who had instituted a legal, process against him, was
accused, by some villanous wretches, of having surprised the King
in bed at the battle of Sorau, and of having afterwards released
him for a bribe.</p>
<p>What was still worse, they hired a common woman, a native of
Br&uuml;nn, who pretended she was the daughter of Marshal
Schwerin, to give in evidence that she herself was with the King
when Trenck entered his tent, whom he immediately made prisoner,
and as immediately released.</p>
<p>To this part of the prosecution I myself, an eye-witness, can
answer: the thing was false and impossible.&nbsp; He was informed
of the intended attack.&nbsp; I accompanied the watchful King
from midnight till four in the morning, which time he employed in
riding through the camp, and making the necessary preparations to
receive the enemy; and the action began at five.&nbsp; Trenck
could not take the King in bed, for the battle was almost gained
when he and his pandours entered the camp and plundered the
head-quarters.</p>
<p>As for the tale of Miss Schwerin, it is only fit to be told by
schoolboys, or examined by the Inquisition, and was very unworthy
of making part of a legal prosecution against an innocent man at
Vienna.</p>
<p>This incident, however, is so remarkable that I shall give in
this work a farther account of my kinsman, and what was called
his criminal process, at reading which the world will be
astonished.&nbsp; My own history is so connected with his that
this is necessary, and the more so because there are many
ignorant or wicked people at Vienna, who believe, or affirm,
Trenck had actually taken the King of Prussia prisoner.</p>
<p>Never yet was there a traitor of the name of Trenck; and I
hope to prove, in the clearest manner, the Austrian Trenck as
faithfully served the Empress-Queen as the Prussian Trenck did
Frederic, his King.&nbsp; Maria Theresa, speaking to me of him
some time after his death, and the snares that had been laid for
him, said, &ldquo;Your kinsman has made a better end than will be
the fate of his accusers and judges.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of this more hereafter: I approach that epoch when my
misfortunes began, and when the sufferings of martyrdom attended
me from youth onward till my hairs grew grey.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>
<p>A few days after the battle of Sorau, the usual camp postman
brought me a letter from my cousin Trenck, the colonel of
pandours, antedated at Effek four months, of which the following
is a copy:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your letter, of the 12th of February, from Berlin,
informs me you desire to have some Hungarian horses.&nbsp; On
these you would come and attack me and my pandours.&nbsp; I saw
with pleasure, during the last campaign, that the Prussian Trenck
was a good soldier; and that I might give you some proofs of my
attachment, I then returned the horses which my men had
taken.&nbsp; If, however, you wish to have Hungarian horses, you
must take mine in like manner from me in the field of battle: or,
should you so think fit, come and join one who will receive you
with open arms, like his friend and son, and who will procure you
every advantage you can desire,&rdquo; &amp;c.</p>
<p>At first I was terrified at reading this letter, yet could not
help smiling.&nbsp; Cornet Wagenitz, now general in chief of the
Hesse Cassel forces, and Lieutenant Grotthausen, both now alive,
and then present, were my camp comrades.&nbsp; I gave them the
letter to read, and they laughed at its contents.&nbsp; It was
determined to show it to our superior officer, Jaschinsky, on a
promise of secrecy, and it was accordingly shown him within an
hour after it was received.</p>
<p>The reader will be so kind as to recollect that, as I have
before said, it was this Colonel Jaschinsky who on the 12th of
February, the same year, at Berlin, prevailed on me to write to
the Austrian Trenck, my cousin; that he received the letter open,
and undertook to send it according to its address; also that, in
this letter, I in jest had asked him to send me some Hungarian
horses, and, should they come, had promised one to
Jaschinsky.&nbsp; He read the letter with an air of some
surprise; we laughed, and, it being whispered through the army
that, in consequence of our late victory, detached corps would be
sent into Hungary, Jaschinsky said, &ldquo;We shall now go and
take Hungarian horses for ourselves.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here the
conversation ended, and I, little suspecting future consequences,
returned to my tent.</p>
<p>I must here remark the following observations:&mdash;</p>
<p>1st.&nbsp; I had not observed the date of the letter brought
by the postman, which, as I have said, was antedated four months:
this, however, the colonel did not fail to remark.</p>
<p>2ndly.&nbsp; The probability is that this was a net, spread
for me by this false and wicked man.&nbsp; The return of my
horses, during the preceding campaign, had been the subject of
much conversation.&nbsp; It is possible he had the King&rsquo;s
orders to watch me; but more probably he only prevailed on me to
write that he might entrap me by a fictitious answer.&nbsp;
Certain it is, my cousin Trenck, at Vienna, affirmed to his death
he never received any letter from me, consequently never could
send any answer.&nbsp; I must therefore conclude this letter was
forged.</p>
<p>Jaschinsky was at this time one of the King&rsquo;s
favourites; his spy over the army; a tale-bearer; an inventor of
wicked lies and calumnies.&nbsp; Some years after the event of
which I am now speaking, the King was obliged to break and banish
him the country.</p>
<p>He was then also the paramour of the beauteous Madame
Brossart, wife of the Saxon resident at Berlin, and there can be
little doubt but that this false letter was, by her means,
conveyed to some Saxon or Austrian post-office, and thence,
according to its address, sent to me.&nbsp; He had daily
opportunities of infusing suspicions into the King&rsquo;s mind
concerning me; and, unknown to me, of pursuing his diabolical
plan.</p>
<p>I must likewise add he was four hundred ducats indebted to
me.&nbsp; At that time I had always a plentiful supply of
money.&nbsp; This booty became his own when I, unexamined, was
arrested, and thrown into prison.&nbsp; In like manner he seized
on the greatest part of my camp equipage.</p>
<p>Further, we had quarrelled during our first campaign, because
he had beaten one of my servants; we even were proceeding to
fight with pistols, had not Colonel Winterfield interfered, and
amicably ended our quarrel.&nbsp; The Lithuanian is, by nature,
obstinate and revengeful; and, from that day, I have reason to
believe he sought my destruction.</p>
<p>God only knows what were the means he took to excite the
King&rsquo;s suspicious; for it is incredible that Frederic,
considering his <i>well-known professions</i> of public justice,
should treat me in the manner he did, without a hearing, without
examination, and without a court-martial.&nbsp; This to me has
ever remained a mystery, which the King alone was able to
explain; he afterwards was convinced I was innocent: but my
sufferings had been too cruel, and the miseries he had inflicted
too horrible, for me ever to hope for compensation.</p>
<p>In an affair of this nature, which will soon he known to all
Europe, as it long has been in Prussia, the weakest is always
guilty.&nbsp; I have been made a terrible example to this our
age, how true that maxim is in despotic States.</p>
<p>A man of my rank, having once unjustly suffered, and not
having the power of making his sufferings known, must ever be
highly rewarded or still more unjustly punished.&nbsp; My name
and injuries will ever stain the annals of Frederic <i>the
Great</i>; even those who read this book will perhaps suppose
that I, from political motives of hope or fear, have sometimes
concealed truth by endeavouring to palliate his conduct.</p>
<p>It must ever remain incomprehensible that a monarch so
clear-sighted, himself the daily witness of my demeanour, one
well acquainted with mankind, and conscious I wanted neither
money, honour, nor hope of future preferment; I say it is
incomprehensible that he should really suppose me guilty.&nbsp; I
take God to witness, and all those who knew me in prosperity and
misfortune, I never harboured a thought of betraying my
country.&nbsp; How was it possible to suspect me?&nbsp; I was
neither madman nor idiot.&nbsp; In my eighteenth year I was a
cornet of the body guard, adjutant to the King, and possessed his
favour and confidence in the highest degree.&nbsp; His presents
to me, in one year, amounted to fifteen hundred dollars.&nbsp; I
kept seven horses, four men in livery; I was valued,
distinguished, and beloved by the mistress of my soul.&nbsp; My
relations held high offices, both civil and military; I was even
fanatically devoted to my King and country, and had nothing to
wish.</p>
<p>That I should become thus wretched, in consequence of this
unfortunate letter, is equally wonderful: it came by the public
post.&nbsp; Had there been any criminal correspondence, my
kinsman certainly would not have chosen this mode of conveyance;
since, it is well known, all such letters are opened; nor could I
act more openly.&nbsp; My colonel read the letter I wrote; and
also that which I received, immediately after it was brought.</p>
<p>The day after the receipt of this letter I was, as I have
before said, unheard, unaccused, unjudged, conducted like a
criminal from the army, by fifty hussars, and imprisoned in the
fortress of Glatz.&nbsp; I was allowed to take three horses, and
my servants, but my whole equipage was left behind, which I never
saw more, and which became the booty of Jaschinsky.&nbsp; My
commission was given to Cornet Schatzel, and I cashiered without
knowing why.&nbsp; There were no legal inquiries made: all was
done by the King&rsquo;s command.</p>
<p>Unhappy people! where power is superior to law, and where the
innocent and the virtuous meet punishment instead of
reward.&nbsp; Unhappy land! where the omnipotent &ldquo;<span
class="smcap">such is our will</span>&rdquo; supersedes all legal
sentence, and robs the subject of property, life, and honour.</p>
<p>I once more repeat I was brought to the citadel of Glatz; I
was not, however, thrown into a dungeon, but imprisoned in a
chamber of the officer of the guard; was allowed my servants to
wait on me, and permitted to walk on the ramparts.</p>
<p>I did not want money, and there was only a detachment from the
garrison regiment in the citadel of Glatz, the officers of which
were all poor.&nbsp; I soon had both friends and freedom, and the
rich prisoner every day kept open table.</p>
<p>He only who had known me in this the ardour of my youth, who
had witnessed how high I aspired, and the fortune that attended
me at Berlin, can imagine what my feelings were at finding myself
thus suddenly cast from my high hopes.</p>
<p>I wrote submissively to the King, requesting to be tried by a
court-martial, and not desiring any favour should I be found
guilty.&nbsp; This haughty tone, in a youth, was displeasing, and
I received no answer, which threw me into despair, and induced me
to use every possible means to obtain my liberty.</p>
<p>My first care was to establish, by the intervention of an
officer, a certain correspondence with the object of my
heart.&nbsp; She answered, she was far from supposing I had ever
entertained the least thought treacherous to my country; that she
knew, too well, I was perfectly incapable, of
dissimulation.&nbsp; She blamed the precipitate anger and unjust
suspicions of the King; promised me speedy aid, and sent me a
thousand ducats.</p>
<p>Had I, at this critical moment, possessed a prudent and
intelligent friend, who could have calmed my impatience, nothing
perhaps might have been more easy than to have obtained pardon
from the King, by proving my innocence; or, it may be, than to
have induced him to punish my enemies.</p>
<p>But the officers who then were at Glatz fed the flame of
discontent.&nbsp; They supposed the money I so freely distributed
came all from Hungary, furnished by the pandour chest; and
advised me not to suffer my freedom to depend upon the will of
the King, but to enjoy it in his despite.</p>
<p>It was not more easy to give this advice than to persuade a
man to take it, who, till then, had never encountered anything
but good fortune, and who consequently supported the reverse with
impatience.&nbsp; I was not yet, however, determined; because I
could not yet resolve to abandon my country, and especially
Berlin.</p>
<p>Five months soon passed away in prison: peace was concluded;
the King was returned to his capital; my commission in the guards
was bestowed on another, when Lieutenant Piaschky, of the
regiment of Fouquet, and Ensign Reitz, who often mounted guard
over me, proposed that they and I should escape together.&nbsp; I
yielded; our plan was fixed, and every preparatory step
taken.</p>
<p>At that time there was another prisoner at Glatz, whose name
was Manget, by birth a Swiss, and captain of cavalry in the
Natzmerschen hussars; he had been broken, and condemned by a
court-martial to ten years&rsquo; imprisonment, with an allowance
of only four rix-dollars per month.</p>
<p>Having done this man kindness, I was resolved to rescue him
from bondage, at the same time that I obtained freedom for
myself.&nbsp; I communicated my design, and made the proposal,
which was accepted by him, and measures were taken; yet were we
betrayed by this vile man, who thus purchased pardon and
liberty.</p>
<p>Piaschky, who had been informed that Reitz was arrested, saved
himself by deserting.&nbsp; I denied the fact in presence of
Manget, with whom I was confronted, and bribed the Auditor with a
hundred ducats.&nbsp; By this means Reitz only suffered a
year&rsquo;s imprisonment, and the loss of his commission.&nbsp;
I was afterwards closely confined in a chamber, for having
endeavoured to corrupt the King&rsquo;s officers, and was guarded
with greater caution.</p>
<p>Here I will interrupt my narrative, for a moment, to relate an
adventure which happened between me and this Captain Manget,
three years after he had thus betrayed me&mdash;that is to say,
in 1749, at Warsaw.</p>
<p>I there met him by chance, and it is not difficult to imagine
what was the salutation he received.&nbsp; I caned him; he took
this ill, and challenged me to fight with pistols.&nbsp; Captain
Heucking, of the Polish guards, was my second.&nbsp; We both
fired together; I shot him through the neck at the first shot,
and he fell dead on the field.</p>
<p>He alone, of all my enemies, ever died by my own hand; and he
well merited his end, for his cowardly treachery towards the two
brave fellows of whom I have spoken; and still more so with
respect to myself, who had been his benefactor.&nbsp; I own, I
have never reproached myself for this duel, by which I sent a
rascal out of the world.</p>
<p>I return to my tale.&nbsp; My destiny at Glatz was now become
more untoward and severe.&nbsp; The King&rsquo;s suspicions were
increased, as likewise was his anger, by this my late attempt to
escape.</p>
<p>Left to myself, I considered my situation in the worst point
of view, and determined either on flight or death.&nbsp; The
length and closeness of my confinement became insupportable to my
impatient temper.</p>
<p>I had always had the garrison on my side, nor was it possible
to prevent my making friends among them.&nbsp; They knew I had
money, and, in a poor garrison regiment, the officers of which
are all dissatisfied, having most of them been drafted from other
corps, and sent thither as a punishment, there was nothing that
might not be undertaken.</p>
<p>My scheme was as follows:&mdash;My window looked towards the
city, and was ninety feet from the ground in the tower of the
citadel, out of which I could not get, without having found a
place of refuge in the city.</p>
<p>This an officer undertook to procure me, and prevailed on an
honest soap-boiler to grant me a hiding place.&nbsp; I then
notched my pen-knife, and sawed through three iron bars; but this
mode was too tedious, it being necessary to file away eight bars
from my window, before I could pass through; another officer
therefore procured me a file, which I was obliged to use with
caution, lest I should be overheard by the sentinels.</p>
<p>Having ended this labour, I cut my leather portmanteau into
thongs, sewed them end to end, added the sheets of my bed, and
descended safely from this astonishing height.</p>
<p>It rained, the night was dark, and all seemed fortunate, but I
had to wade through moats full of mud, before I could enter the
city, a circumstance I had never once considered.&nbsp; I sank up
to the knees, and after long struggling, and incredible efforts
to extricate myself, I was obliged to call the sentinel, and
desire him to go and tell the governor, Trenck was stuck fast in
the moat.</p>
<p>My misfortune was the greater on this occasion, because that
General Fouquet was then governor of Glatz.&nbsp; He was one of
the cruellest of men.&nbsp; He had been wounded by my father in a
duel; and the Austrian Trenck had taken his baggage in 1744, and
had also laid the country of Glatz under contribution.&nbsp; He
was, therefore, an enemy to the very name of Trenck; nor did he
lose any opportunity of giving proofs of his enmity, and
especially on the present occasion, when he left me standing in
the mire till noon, the sport of the soldiers.&nbsp; I was then
drawn out, half dead, only again to be imprisoned, and shut up
the whole day, without water to wash me.&nbsp; No one can imagine
how I looked, exhausted and dirty, my long hair having fallen
into the mud, with which, by my struggling, it was loaded.</p>
<p>I remained in this condition till the next day, when two
fellow-prisoners were sent to assist and clean me.</p>
<p>My imprisonment now became more intolerable.&nbsp; I had still
eighty louis-d&rsquo;ors in my purse, which had not been taken
from me at my removal into another dungeon, and these afterwards
did me good service.</p>
<p>The passions soon all assailed me at once, and impetuous,
boiling, youthful blood overpowered reason; hope disappeared; I
thought myself the most unfortunate of men, and my King an
irreconcileable judge, more wrathful and more fortified in
suspicion by my own rashness.&nbsp; My nights were sleepless, my
days miserable; my soul was tortured by the desire of fame; a
consciousness of innocence was a continued stimulus inciting me
to end my misfortunes.&nbsp; Youth, inexperienced in woe and
disastrous fate, beholds every evil magnified, and desponds on
every new disappointment, more especially after having failed in
attempting freedom.&nbsp; Education had taught me to despise
death, and these opinions had been confirmed by my friend La
Mettrie, author of the famous work, &ldquo;L&rsquo;Homme
Machine,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Man a Machine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I read much during my confinement at Glatz, where books were
allowed me; time was therefore less tedious; but when the love of
liberty awoke, when fame and affection called me to Berlin, and
my baulked hopes painted the wretchedness of my situation; when I
remembered that my loved country, judging by appearances, could
not but pronounce me a traitor; then was I hourly impelled to
rush on the naked bayonets of my guards, by whom, to me, the road
of freedom was barred.</p>
<p>Big with such-like thoughts, eight days had not elapsed since
my last fruitless attempt to escape, when an event happened which
would appear incredible, were I, the principal actor in the
scene, not alive to attest its truth, and might not all Glatz and
the Prussian garrison be produced as eye and ear witnesses.&nbsp;
This incident will prove that adventurous, and even rash, daring
will render the most improbable undertakings possible, and that
desperate attempts may often make a general more fortunate and
famous than the wisest and best concerted plans.</p>
<p>Major Doo <a name="citation2"></a><a href="#footnote2"
class="citation">[2]</a> came to visit me, accompanied by an
officer of the guard, and an adjutant.&nbsp; After examining
every corner of my chamber, he addressed me, taxing me with a
second crime in endeavouring to obtain my liberty; adding this
must certainly increase the anger of the King.</p>
<p>My blood boiled at the word crime; he talked of patience; I
asked him how long the King had condemned me to imprisonment; he
answered, a traitor to his country, who has correspondence with
the enemy, cannot be condemned for a certain time, but must
depend for grace and pardon on the King.</p>
<p>At that instant I snatched his sword from his side, on which
my eyes had some time been fixed, sprang out of the door, tumbled
the sentinel from the top to the bottom of the stairs, passed the
men who happened to be drawn up before the prison door to relieve
the guard, attacked them sword in hand, threw them suddenly into
surprise by the manner in which I laid about me, wounded four of
them, made way through the rest, sprang over the breastwork of
the ramparts, and, with my sword drawn in my hand, immediately
leaped this astonishing height without receiving the least
injury.&nbsp; I leaped the second wall with equal safety and good
fortune.&nbsp; None of their pieces were loaded; no one durst
leap after me, and in order to pursue, they must go round through
the town and gate of the citadel; so that I had the start full
half an hour.</p>
<p>A sentinel, however, in a narrow passage, endeavoured to
oppose my flight, but I parried his fixed bayonet, and wounded
him in the face.&nbsp; A second sentinel, meantime, ran from the
outworks, to seize me behind, and I, to avoid him, made a spring
at the palisadoes; there I was unluckily caught by the foot, and
received a bayonet wound in the upper lip; thus entangled, they
beat me with the butt-end of their muskets, and dragged me back
to prison, while I struggled and defended myself like a man grown
desperate.</p>
<p>Certain it is, had I more carefully jumped the palisadoes, and
despatched the sentinel who opposed me, I might have escaped, and
gained the mountains.&nbsp; Thus might I have fled to Bohemia,
after having, at noonday, broken from the fortress of Glatz,
sprung past all its sentinels, over all its walls, and passed
with impunity, in despite of the guard, who were under arms,
ready to oppose me.&nbsp; I should not, having a sword, have
feared any single opponent, and was able to contend with the
swiftest runners.</p>
<p>That good fortune which had so far attended me forsook me at
the palisadoes, where hope was at an end.&nbsp; The severities of
imprisonment were increased; two sentinels and an under officer
were locked in with me, and were themselves guarded by sentinels
without; I was beaten and wounded by the butt-ends of their
muskets, my right foot was sprained, I spat blood, and my wounds
were not cured in less than a month.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>
<p>I was now first informed that the King had only condemned me
to a year&rsquo;s imprisonment, in order to learn whether his
suspicions were well founded.&nbsp; My mother had petitioned for
me, and was answered, &ldquo;Your son must remain a year
imprisoned, as a punishment for his rash
correspondence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of this I was ignorant, and it was reported in Glatz that my
imprisonment was for life.&nbsp; I had only three weeks longer to
repine for the loss of liberty, when I made this rash
attempt.&nbsp; What must the King think?&nbsp; Was he not obliged
to act with this severity?&nbsp; How could prudence excuse my
impatience, thus to risk a confiscation, when I was certain of
receiving freedom, justification, and honour, in three
weeks?&nbsp; But, such was my adverse fate, circumstances all
tended to injure and persecute me, till at length I gave reason
to suppose I was a traitor, notwithstanding the purity of my
intentions.</p>
<p>Once more, then, was I in a dungeon, and no sooner was I there
than I formed new projects of flight.&nbsp; I first gained the
intimacy of my guards.&nbsp; I had money, and this, with the
compassion I had inspired, might effect anything among
discontented Prussian soldiers.&nbsp; Soon had I gained
thirty-two men, who were ready to execute, on the first signal,
whatever I should command.&nbsp; Two or three excepted, they were
unacquainted with each other; they consequently could not all be
betrayed at a time: had chosen the sub-officer Nicholai to head
them.</p>
<p>The garrison consisted only of one hundred and twenty men from
the garrison regiment, the rest being dispersed in the county of
Glatz, and four officers, their commanders, three of whom were in
my interest.&nbsp; Everything was prepared; swords and pistols
were concealed in the oven which was in my prison.&nbsp; We
intended to give liberty to all the prisoners, and retire with
drums beating into Bohemia.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, an Austrian deserter, to whom Nicholai had
imparted our design, went and discovered our conspiracy.&nbsp;
The governor instantly sent his adjutant to the citadel, with
orders that the officer on guard should arrest Nicholai, and,
with his men, take possession of the casement.</p>
<p>Nicholai was on the guard, and the lieutenant was my friend,
and being in the secret, gave the signal that all was
discovered.&nbsp; Nicholai only knew all the conspirators,
several of whom that day were on guard.&nbsp; He instantly formed
his resolution, leaped into the casement, crying,
&ldquo;Comrades, to arms, we are betrayed!&rdquo;&nbsp; All
followed to the guard-house, where they seized on the cartridges,
the officer having only eight men, and threatening to fire on
whoever should offer resistance, came to deliver me from prison;
but the iron door was too strong, and the time too short for that
to be demolished.&nbsp; Nicholai, calling to me, bid me aid them,
but in vain: and perceiving nothing more could be done for me,
this brave man, heading nineteen others, marched to the gate of
the citadel, where there was a sub-officer and ten soldiers,
obliged these to accompany him, and thus arrived safely at
Braunau, in Bohemia; for, before the news was spread through the
city, and men were collected for the pursuit, they were nearly
half-way on their journey.</p>
<p>Two years after I met with this extraordinary man at
Ofenbourg, where hue was a writer: he entered immediately into my
service, and became my friend, but died some months after of a
burning fever, at my quarters in Hungary, at which I was deeply
grieved, for his memory will be ever dear to me.</p>
<p>Now was I exposed to all the storms of ill-fortune: a
prosecution was entered against me as a conspirator, who wanted
to corrupt the officers and soldiers of the King.&nbsp; They
commanded me to name the remaining conspirators; but to these
questions I made no answer, except by steadfastly declaring I was
an innocent prisoner, an officer unjustly broken; unjustly,
because I had never been brought to trial; that consequently I
was released from all my engagements; nor could it be thought
extraordinary that I should avail myself of that law of nature
which gives every man a right to defend his honour defamed, and
seek by every possible means to regain his liberty: that such had
been my sole purpose in every enterprise I had formed, and such
should still continue to be, for I was determined to persist,
till I should either be crowned with success, or lose my life in
the attempt.</p>
<p>Things thus remained: every precaution was taken except that I
was not put in irons; it being a law in Prussia that no gentleman
or officer can be loaded with chains, unless he has first for
some crime been delivered over to the executioner; and certainly
this had not been my case.</p>
<p>The soldiers were withdrawn from my chamber; but the greatest
ill was I had expended all my money, and my kind mistress, at
Berlin, with whom I had always corresponded, and which my
persecutors could not prevent, at last wrote&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;My tears flow with yours; the evil is
without remedy&mdash;I dare no more&mdash;escape if you
can.&nbsp; My fidelity will ever be the same, when it shall be
possible for me to serve you.&mdash;Adieu, unhappy friend: you
merit a better fate.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This letter was a thunderbolt:&mdash;my comfort, however,
still was that the officers were not suspected, and that it was
their duty to visit my chamber several times a day, and examine
what passed: from which circumstance I felt my hopes somewhat
revive.&nbsp; Hence an adventure happened which is almost
unexampled in tales of knight-errantry.</p>
<p>A lieutenant, whose name was Bach, a Dane by nation, mounted
guard every fourth day, and was the terror of the whole garrison;
for, being a perfect master of arms, he was incessantly involved
in quarrels, and generally left his marks behind him.&nbsp; He
had served in two regiments, neither of which would associate
with him for this reason, and he had been sent to the garrison
regiment at Glatz as punishment.</p>
<p>Bach one day, sitting beside me, related how, the evening
before, he had wounded a lieutenant, of the name of Schell, in
the arm.&nbsp; I replied, laughing, &ldquo;Had I my liberty, I
believe you would find some trouble in wounding me, for I have
some skill in the sword.&rdquo;&nbsp; The blood instantly flew in
his face; we split off a kind of pair of foils from an old door,
which had served me as a table, and at the first lunge I hit him
on the breast.</p>
<p>His rage became ungovernable, and he left the prison.&nbsp;
What was my astonishment when, a moment after, I saw him return
with two soldiers&rsquo; swords, which he had concealed under his
coat.&mdash;&ldquo;Now, then, boaster, prove,&rdquo; said he,
giving me one of them, &ldquo;what thou art able to
do.&rdquo;&nbsp; I endeavoured to pacify him, by representing the
danger, but ineffectually.&nbsp; He attacked me with the utmost
fury, and I wounded him in the arm.</p>
<p>Throwing his sword down, he fell upon my neck, kissed me, and
wept.&nbsp; At length, after some convulsive emotions of
pleasure, he said, &ldquo;Friend, thou art my master; and thou
must, thou shalt, by my aid, obtain thy liberty, as certainly as
my name is Bach.&rdquo;&nbsp; We bound up his arm as well as we
could.&nbsp; He left me, and secretly went to a surgeon, to have
it properly dressed, and at night returned.</p>
<p>He now remarked, that it was humanly impossible I should
escape, unless the officer on guard should desert with
me;&mdash;that he wished nothing more ardently than to sacrifice
his life in my behalf, but that he could not resolve so far to
forget his honour and duty to desert, himself, while on guard: he
notwithstanding gave me his word of honour he would find me such
a person in a few days; and that, in the meantime, he would
prepare everything for my flight.</p>
<p>He returned the same evening, bringing with him Lieutenant
Schell, and as he entered said, &ldquo;Here is your
man.&rdquo;&nbsp; Schell embraced me, gave his word of honour,
and thus was the affair settled, and as it proved, my liberty
ascertained.</p>
<p>We soon began to deliberate on the means necessary to obtain
our purpose.&nbsp; Schell was just come from garrison at
Habelchwert to the citadel of Glatz, and in two days was to mount
guard over me, till when our attempt was suspended.&nbsp; I have
before said, I received no more supplies from my beloved
mistress, and my purse at that time only contained some six
pistoles.&nbsp; It was therefore resolved that Bach should go to
Schweidnitz, and obtain money of a sure friend of mine in that
city.</p>
<p>Here must I inform the reader that at this period the officers
and I all understood each other, Captain Roder alone excepted,
who was exact, rigid, and gave trouble on all occasions.</p>
<p>Major Quaadt was my kinsman, by my mother&rsquo;s side, a
good, friendly man, and ardently desirous I should escape, seeing
my calamities were so much increased.&nbsp; The four lieutenants
who successively mounted guard over me were Bach, Schroeder,
Lunitz, and Schell.&nbsp; The first was the grand projector, and
made all preparations; Schell was to desert with me; and
Schroeder and Lunitz three days after were to follow.</p>
<p>No one ought to be surprised that officers of garrison
regiments should be so ready to desert.&nbsp; They are, in
general, either men of violent passions, quarrelsome, overwhelmed
with debts, or unfit for service.&nbsp; They are usually sent to
the garrison as a punishment, and are called the refuse of the
army.&nbsp; Dissatisfied with their situation, their pay much
reduced, and despised by the troops, such men, expecting
advantage, may be brought to engage in the most desperate
undertaking.&nbsp; None of them can hope for their discharge, and
they live in the utmost poverty.&nbsp; They all hoped by my means
to better their fortune, I always having had money enough; and,
with money, nothing is more easy than to find friends, in places
where each individual is desirous of escaping from slavery.</p>
<p>The talents of Schell were of a superior order; he spoke and
wrote six languages, and was well acquainted with all the fine
arts.&nbsp; He had served in the regiment of Fouquet, had been
injured by his colonel, who was a Pomeranian; and Fouquet, who
was no friend to well-informed officers, had sent him to a
garrison regiment.&nbsp; He had twice demanded his dismissal, but
the King sent him to this species of imprisonment; he then
determined to avenge himself by deserting, and was ready to aid
me in recovering my freedom, that he might, by that means, spite
Fouquet.</p>
<p>I shall speak more hereafter of this extraordinary man, that I
must not in this place interrupt my story.&nbsp; We determined
everything should be prepared against the first time Schell
mounted guard, and that our project should be executed on our
next.&nbsp; Thus, as he mounted guard every four days, the eighth
was to be that of our flight.</p>
<p>The governor meantime had been informed how familiar I was
become with the officers, at which taking offence, he sent orders
that my door should no more be opened, but that I should receive
my food through a small window that had been made for the
purpose.&nbsp; The care of the prison was committed to the major,
and he was forbidden to eat with me, under pain of being
broken.</p>
<p>His precautions were ineffectual; the officers procured a
false key, and remained with me half the day and night.</p>
<p>Captain Damnitz was imprisoned in an apartment by the side of
mine.&nbsp; This man had deserted from the Prussian service, with
the money belonging to his company, to Austria, where he obtained
a commission in his cousin&rsquo;s regiment, who having prevailed
on him to serve as a spy, during the campaign of 1744, he was
taken in the Prussian territories, known, and condemned to be
hanged.</p>
<p>Some Swedish volunteers, who were then in the army, interested
themselves in his behalf, and his sentence was changed to
perpetual imprisonment, with a sentence of infamy.</p>
<p>This wretch, who two years after, by the aid of his
protectors, not only obtained his liberty but a
lieutenant-colonel&rsquo;s commission, was the secret spy of the
major over the prisoners; and he remarked that, notwithstanding
the express prohibition laid on the officers, they still passed
the greater part of their time in my company.</p>
<p>The 24th of December came, and Schell mounted guard.&nbsp; He
entered my prison immediately, where he continued a long time,
and we made our arrangements for flight when he next should mount
guard.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Schroeder that day dined with the governor, and
heard orders given to the adjutant that Schell should be taken
from the guard, and put under arrest.</p>
<p>Schroeder, who was in the secret, had no doubt but that we
were betrayed, not knowing that the spy Damnitz had informed the
governor that Schell was then in my chamber.</p>
<p>Schroeder, full of terror, came running to the citadel, and
said to Schell, &ldquo;Save thyself, friend; all is discovered,
and thou wilt instantly be put under arrest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Schell might easily have provided for his own safety, by
flying singly, Schroeder having prepared horses, on one of which
he himself offered to accompany him into Bohemia.&nbsp; How did
this worthy man, in a moment so dangerous, act toward his
friend?</p>
<p>Running suddenly into my prison, he drew a corporal&rsquo;s
sabre from under his coat, and said, &ldquo;Friend, we are
betrayed; follow me, only do not suffer me to fall alive into the
hands of my enemies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I would have spoken: but interrupting me, and taking me by the
hand, he added, &ldquo;Follow me; we have not a moment to
lose.&rdquo;&nbsp; I therefore slipped on my coat and boots,
without having time to take the little money I had left; and, as
we went out of the prison, Schell said to the sentinel, &ldquo;I
am taking the prisoner into the officer&rsquo;s apartment; stand
where you are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Into this room we really went, but passed out at the other
door.&nbsp; The design of Schell was to go under the arsenal,
which was not far off, to gain the covered way, leap the
palisadoes, and afterwards escape after the best manner we
might.</p>
<p>We had scarcely gone a hundred paces before we met the
adjutant and Major Quaadt.</p>
<p>Schell started back, sprang upon the rampart, and leaped from
the wall, which was there not very high.&nbsp; I followed, and
alighted unhurt, except having grazed my shoulder.&nbsp; My poor
friend was not so fortunate; having put out his ankle.&nbsp; He
immediately drew his sword, presented it to me, and begged me to
despatch him, and fly.&nbsp; He was a small, weak man: but, far
from complying with his request, I took him in my arms, threw him
over the palisadoes, afterwards got him on my back, and began to
run, without very well knowing which way I went.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>
<p>It may not be unnecessary to remark those fortunate
circumstances that favoured our enterprise.</p>
<p>The sun had just set as we took to flight; the hoar frost
fell.&nbsp; No one would run the risk that we had done, by making
so dangerous a leap.&nbsp; We heard a terrible noise behind
us.&nbsp; Everybody knew us; but before they could go round the
citadel, and through the town, in order to pursue us, we had got
a full half league.</p>
<p>The alarm guns were fired before we were a hundred paces
distant; at which my friend was very much terrified, knowing that
in such cases it was generally impossible to escape from Glatz,
unless the fugitives had got the start full two hours before the
alarm guns were heard; the passes being immediately all stopped
by the peasants and hussars, who are exceedingly vigilant.&nbsp;
No sooner is a prisoner missed than the gunner runs from the
guard-house, and fires the cannon on the three sides of the
fortress, which are kept loaded day and night for that
purpose.</p>
<p>We were not five hundred paces from the walls, when all before
us and behind us were in motion.&nbsp; It was daylight when we
leaped, yet was our attempt as fortunate as it was wonderful:
this I attributed to my presence of mind, and the reputation I
had already acquired, which made it thought a service of danger
for two or three men to attack me.</p>
<p>It was besides imagined we were well provided with arms for
our defence; and it was little suspected that Schell had only his
sword, and I an old corporal&rsquo;s sabre.</p>
<p>Among the officers commanded to pursue us was Lieutenant Bart,
my intimate friend.&nbsp; Captain Zerbst, of the regiment of
Fouquet, who had always testified the kindness of a brother
towards me, met us on the Bohemian frontiers, and called to me,
&ldquo;Make to time left, brother, and you will see some lone
houses, which are on the Bohemian confines: the hussars have
ridden straight forward.&rdquo;&nbsp; He then passed on as if he
had not seen us.</p>
<p>We had nothing to fear from the officers; for the intimacy
between the Prussian officers was at that time so great, and the
word of honour so sacred, that during my rigorous detention at
Glatz I had been once six-and-thirty hours hunting at Neurode, at
the seat of Baron Stillfriede; Lunitz had taken my place in the
prison, which the major knew when he came to make his
visit.&nbsp; Hence may be conjectured how great was the
confidence in which the word of the unfortunate Trenck was held
at Glatz, since they did not fear letting him leave his dungeon,
and hunt on the very confines of Bohemia.&nbsp; This, too, shows
the governor was deceived, in despite of his watchfulness and
order, and that a man of honour, with money, and a good head and
heart, will never want friends.</p>
<p>These my memoirs will be the picture of what the national
character then was; and will prove that, with officers who lived
like brothers, and held their words so sacred, the great
Frederick well might vanquish his enemies.</p>
<p>Arbitrary power has now introduced the whip of slavery, and
mechanic subordination has eradicated those noble and rational
incitements to concord and honour.&nbsp; Instead of which,
mistrust and slavish fear having arisen, the enthusiastic spirit
of the Brandenburg warrior declines, and into this error have
most of the other European States fallen.</p>
<p>Scarcely had I borne my friend three hundred paces before I
set him down, and I looked round me, but darkness came on so fast
that I could see neither town nor citadel; consequently, we
ourselves could not be seen.</p>
<p>My presence of mind did not forsake me: death or freedom was
my determination.&nbsp; &ldquo;Where are we, Schell?&rdquo; said
I to my friend.&nbsp; &ldquo;Where does Bohemia lie? on which
side is the river Neiss?&rdquo;&nbsp; The worthy man could make
no answer: his mind was all confusion, and he despaired of our
escape: he still, however, entreated I would not let him be taken
alive, and affirmed my labour was all in vain.</p>
<p>After having promised, by all that was sacred, I would save
him from an infamous death, if no other means were left, and thus
raised his spirits, he looked round, and knew, by some trees, we
were not far from the city gates.&nbsp; I asked him, &ldquo;Where
is the Neiss?&rdquo;&nbsp; He pointed sideways&mdash;&ldquo;All
Glatz has seen us fly towards the Bohemian mountains; it is
impossible we should avoid the hussars, the passes being all
guarded, and we beset with enemies.&rdquo;&nbsp; So saying, I
took him on my shoulders, and carried him to the Neiss; here we
distinctly heard the alarm sounded in the villages, and the
peasants, who likewise were to form the line of desertion, were
everywhere in motion, and spreading the alarm.&nbsp; As it may
not be known to all my readers in what manner they proceed on
these occasions in Prussia, I will here give a short account of
it.</p>
<p>Officers are daily named on the parade whose duty it is to
follow fugitives as soon as the alarm-guns are fired.</p>
<p>The peasants in the villages, likewise, are daily appointed to
rim to the guard of certain posts.&nbsp; The officers immediately
fly to these posts to see that the peasants do their duty, and
prevent the prisoner&rsquo;s escape.&nbsp; Thus does it seldom
happen that a soldier can effect his escape unless he be, at the
very least, an hour on the road before the alarm-guns are
fired.</p>
<p>I now return to my story.</p>
<p>I came to the Neiss, which was a little frozen, entered it
with my friend, and carried him as long as I could wade, and when
I could not feel the bottom, which did not continue for more than
a space of eighteen feet, he clung round me, and thus we got
safely to the other shore.</p>
<p>My father taught all his sons to swim, for which I have often
had to thank him; since by means of this art, which is easily
learnt in childhood, I had on various occasions preserved my
life, and was more bold in danger.&nbsp; Princes who wish to make
their subjects soldiers, should have them educated so as to fear
neither fire nor water.&nbsp; How great would be the advantage of
being able to cross a river with whole battalions, when it is
necessary to attack or retreat before the enemy, and when time
will not permit to prepare bridges!</p>
<p>The reader will easily suppose swimming in the midst of
December, and remaining afterwards eighteen hours in the open
air, was a severe hardship.&nbsp; About seven o&rsquo;clock the
hoar-fog was succeeded by frost and moonlight.&nbsp; The carrying
of my friend kept me warm, it is true, but I began to be tired,
while he suffered everything that frost, the pain of a dislocated
foot (which I in vain endeavoured to reset), and the danger of
death from a thousand hands, could inflict.</p>
<p>We were somewhat more tranquil, however, having reached the
opposite shore of the Neiss, since nobody would pursue us on the
road to Silesia.&nbsp; I followed the course of the river for
half an hour, and having once passed the first villages that
formed the line of desertion, with which Schell was perfectly
acquainted, we in a lucky moment found a fisherman&rsquo;s boat
moored to the shore; into this we leaped, crossed the river
again, and soon gained the mountains.</p>
<p>Here being come, we sat ourselves down awhile on the snow;
hope revived in our hearts, and we held council concerning how it
was best to act.&nbsp; I cut a stick to assist Schell in hopping
forward as well as he could when I was tired of carrying him; and
thus we continued our route, the difficulties of which were
increased by the mountain snows.</p>
<p>Thus passed the night; during which, up to the middle in snow,
we made but little way.&nbsp; There were no paths to be traced in
the mountains, and they were in many places impassable.&nbsp; Day
at length appeared: we thought ourselves near the frontiers,
which are twenty English miles from Glatz, when we suddenly, to
our great terror, heard the city clock strike.</p>
<p>Overwhelmed, as we were, by hunger, cold, fatigue, and pain,
it was impossible we should hold out through the day.&nbsp; After
some consideration, and another half-hour&rsquo;s labour, we came
to a village at the foot of the mountain, on the side of which,
about three hundred paces from us, we perceived two separate
houses, which inspired us with a stratagem that was
successful.</p>
<p>We lost our hats in leaping the ramparts; but Schell had
preserved his scarf and gorget, which would give him authority
among the peasants.</p>
<p>I then cut my finger, rubbed the blood over my face, my shirt,
and my coat, and bound up my head, to give myself the appearance
of a man dangerously wounded.</p>
<p>In this condition I carried Schell to the end of the wood not
far from these houses; here he tied my hands behind my back, but
so that I could easily disengage them in ease of need: and
hobbled after me, by aid of his staff, calling for help.</p>
<p>Two old peasants appeared, and Schell commanded them to run to
the village, and tell a magistrate to come immediately with a
cart.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have seized this knave,&rdquo; added he,
&ldquo;who has killed my horse, and in the struggle I have put
out my ankle; however, I have wounded and bound him; fly quickly,
bring a cart, lest he should die before he is hanged.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As for me, I suffered myself to be led, as if half-dead, into
the house.&nbsp; A peasant was despatched to the village.&nbsp;
An old woman and a pretty girl seemed to take great pity on me,
and gave me some bread and milk: but how great was our
astonishment when the aged peasant called Schell by his name, and
told him he well knew we were deserters, having the night before
been at a neighbouring alehouse where the officer in pursuit of
us came, named and described us, and related the whole history of
our flight.&nbsp; The peasant knew Schell, because his son served
in his company, and had often spoken of him when he was quartered
at Habelschwert.</p>
<p>Presence of mind and resolution were all that were now
left.&nbsp; I instantly ran to the stable, while Schell detained
the peasant in the chamber.&nbsp; He, however, was a worthy man,
and directed him to the road toward Bohemia.&nbsp; We were still
about some seven miles from Glatz, having lost ourselves among
the mountains, where we had wandered many miles.&nbsp; The
daughter followed me: I found three horses in the stable, but no
bridles.&nbsp; I conjured her, in the most passionate manner, to
assist me: she was affected, seemed half willing to follow me,
and gave me two bridles.&nbsp; I led the horses to the door,
called Schell, and helped him, with his lame leg, on
horseback.&nbsp; The old peasant then began to weep, and beg I
would not take his horses; but he luckily wanted courage, and
perhaps the will to impede us; for with nothing more than a
dung-fork, in our then feeble condition, he might have stopped us
long enough to have called in assistance from the village.</p>
<p>And now behold us on horseback, without hats or saddles;
Schell with his uniform scarf and gorget, and I in my red
regimental coat.&nbsp; Still we were in danger of seeing all our
hopes vanish, for my horse would not stir from the stable;
however, at last, good horseman-like, I made him move: Schell led
the way, and we had scarcely gone a hundred paces, before we
perceived the peasants coming in crowds from the village.</p>
<p>As kind fortune would have it, the people were all at church,
it being a festival: the peasants Schell had sent were obliged to
call aid out of church.&nbsp; It was but nine in the morning; and
had the peasants been at home, we had been lost past
redemption.</p>
<p>We were obliged to take the road to Wunshelburg, and pass
through the town where Schell had been quartered a month before,
and in which he was known by everybody.&nbsp; Our dress, without
hats or saddles, sufficiently proclaimed we were deserters: our
horses, however, continued to go tolerably well, and we had the
good luck to get through the town, although there was a garrison
of one hundred and eighty infantry, and twelve horse, purposely
to arrest deserters.&nbsp; Schell knew the road to Brummem, where
we arrived at eleven o&rsquo;clock, after having met, as I before
mentioned, Captain Zerbst.</p>
<p>He who has been in the same situation only can imagine, though
he never can describe, all the joy we felt.&nbsp; An innocent
man, languishing in a dungeon, who by his own endeavours, has
broken his chains, and regained his liberty, in despite of all
the arbitrary power of princes, who vainly would oppose him,
conceives in moments like these such an abhorrence of despotism,
that I could not well comprehend how I ever could resolve to live
under governments where wealth, content, honour, liberty, and
life all depend upon a master&rsquo;s will, and who, were his
intentions the most pure, could not be able, singly, to do
justice to a whole nation.</p>
<p>Never did I, during life, feel pleasure more exquisite than at
this moment.&nbsp; My friend for me had risked a shameful death,
and now, after having carried him at least twelve hours on my
shoulders, I had saved both him and myself.&nbsp; We certainly
should not have suffered any man to bring us, alive, back to
Glatz.&nbsp; Yet this was but the first act of the tragedy of
which I was doomed the hero, and the mournful incidents of which
all arose out of, and depended on, each other.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>
<p>Could I have read the book of fate, and have seen the forty
years&rsquo; fearful afflictions that were to follow, I certainly
should not have rejoiced at this my escape from Glatz.&nbsp; One
year&rsquo;s patience might have appeased the irritated monarch,
and, taking a retrospect of all that has passed, I now find it
would have been a fortunate circumstance, had the good and
faithful Schell and I never met, since he also fell into a train
of misfortunes, which I shall hereafter relate, and from which he
could never extricate himself, but by death.&nbsp; The sufferings
which I have since undergone will be read with astonishment.</p>
<p>It is my consolation that both the laws of honour and nature
justify the action.&nbsp; I may serve as an example of the
fortitude with which danger ought to be encountered, and show
monarchs that in Germany, as well as in Rome, there are men who
refuse to crouch beneath the yoke of despotism, and that
philosophy and resolution are stronger than even those lords of
slaves, with all their threats, whips, tortures, and instruments
of death.</p>
<p>In Prussia, where my sufferings might have made me supposed
the worst of traitors, is my innocence universally acknowledged;
and instead of contempt, there have I gained the love of the
whole nation, which is the best compensation for all the ills I
have suffered, and for having persevered in the virtuous
principles taught me in my youth, persecuted as I have been by
envy and malicious power.&nbsp; I have not time further to
moralise; the numerous incidents of my life would otherwise swell
this volume to too great an extent.</p>
<p>Thus in freedom at Braunau, on the Bohemian frontiers, I sent
the two horses, with the corporal&rsquo;s sword, back to General
Fouquet, at Glatz.&nbsp; The letter accompanying them was so
pleasing to him that all the sentinels before my prison door, as
well as the guard under arms, and all those we passed, were
obliged to run the gauntlet, although the very day before he had
himself declared my escape was now rendered impossible.&nbsp; He,
however, was deceived; and thus do the mean revenge themselves on
the miserable, and the tyrant on the innocent.</p>
<p>And now for the first time did I quit my country, and fly like
Joseph from the pit into which his false brethren had cast him;
and in this the present moment of joy for my escape, the loss
even of friends and country appeared to me the excess of good
fortune.</p>
<p>The estates which had been purchased by the blood of my
forefathers were confiscated; and thus was a youth, of one of the
noblest families in the land, whose heart was all zeal for the
service of his King and country, and who was among those most
capable to render them service, banished by his unjust and misled
King, and treated like the worst of miscreants, malefactors, and
traitors.</p>
<p>I wrote to the King, and sent him a true state of my case;
sent indubitable proofs of my innocence, and supplicated justice,
but received no answer.</p>
<p>In this the monarch may be justified, at least in my
apprehension.&nbsp; A wicked man had maliciously and falsely
accused me; Colonel Jaschinsky had made him suspect me for a
traitor, and it was impossible he should read my heart.&nbsp; The
first act of injustice had been hastily committed; I had been
condemned unheard, unjudged; and the injustice that had been done
me was known too late; Frederic the Great found he was not
infallible.&nbsp; Pardon I would not ask, for I had committed no
offence; and the King would not probably own, by a reverse of
conduct, he had been guilty of injustice.&nbsp; My resolution
increased his obstinacy: but, in the discussion of the cause, our
power was very unequal.</p>
<p>The monarch once really loved me; he meant my punishment
should only be temporary, and as a trial of my fidelity.&nbsp;
That I had been condemned to no more than a year&rsquo;s
imprisonment had never been told me, and was a fact I did not
learn till long after.</p>
<p>Major Doo, who, as I have said, was the creature of Fouquet, a
mean and covetous man, knowing I had money, had always acted the
part of a protector as he pretended to me, and continually told
me I was condemned for life.&nbsp; He perpetually turned the
conversation on the great credit of his general with the King,
and his own great credit with the general.&nbsp; For the present
of a horse, on which I rode to Glatz, he gave me freedom of
walking about the fortress; and for another, worth a hundred
ducats, I rescued Ensign Reitz from death, who had been betrayed
when endeavouring to effect our escape.&nbsp; I have been assured
that on that very day on which I snatched his sword from his
side, desperately passed through the garrison, and leaped the
walls of the rampart, he was expressly come to tell me, after
some prefatory threats, that by his general&rsquo;s intercession,
my punishment was only to be a year&rsquo;s imprisonment, and
that consequently I should be released in a few days.</p>
<p>How vile were means like these to wrest money from the
unfortunate!&nbsp; The King, after this my mad flight, certainly
was never informed of the major&rsquo;s base cunning; he could
only be told that, rather than wait a few days, I had chosen, in
this desperate manner, to make my escape, and go over to the
enemy.</p>
<p>Thus deceived and strengthened in his suspicion, must he not
imagine my desire to forsake my country, and desert to the enemy,
was unbounded?&nbsp; How could he do otherwise than imprison a
subject who thus endeavoured to injure him and aid his
foes?&nbsp; Thus, by the calumnies of wicked men, did my cruel
destiny daily become more severe; and at length render the
deceived monarch irreconcilable and cruel.</p>
<p>Yet how could it be supposed that I would not willingly have
remained three weeks longer in prison, to have been honourably
restored to liberty, to have prevented the confiscation of my
estate, and to have once more returned to my beloved mistress at
Berlin.</p>
<p>And now was I in Bohemia, a fugitive stranger without money,
protector, or friend, and only twenty years of age.</p>
<p>In the campaign of 1744 I had been quartered at Braunau with a
weaver, whom I advised and assisted to bury his effects, and
preserve them from being plundered.&nbsp; The worthy man received
us with joy and gratitude.&nbsp; I had lived in this same house
but two years before as absolute master of him and his
fate.&nbsp; I had then nine horses and five servants, with the
highest and most favourable hopes of futurity; but now I came a
fugitive, seeking protection, and having lost all a youth like me
had to lose.</p>
<p>I had but a single louis-d&rsquo;or in my purse, and Schell
forty kreutzers, or some three shillings; with this small sum, in
a strange country, we had to cure his sprain, and provide for all
our wants.</p>
<p>I was determined not to go to my cousin Trenck at Vienna,
fearful this should seem a justification of all my imputed
treasons; I rather wished to embark for the East Indies, than to
have recourse to this expedient.&nbsp; The greater my delicacy
was the greater became my distress.&nbsp; I wrote to my mistress
at Berlin, but received no answer; possibly because I could not
indicate any certain mode of conveyance.&nbsp; My mother believed
me guilty, and abandoned me; my brothers were still minors, and
my friend at Schweidnitz could not aid me, being gone to
K&ouml;nigsberg.</p>
<p>After three weeks&rsquo; abode at Braunau, my friend recovered
of his lameness.&nbsp; We had been obliged to sell my watch, with
his scarf and gorget, to supply our necessities, and had only
four florins remaining.</p>
<p>From the public papers I learned my cousin, the Austrian
Trenck, was at this time closely confined, and under criminal
prosecution.&nbsp; It will easily be imagined what effect this
news had upon me.</p>
<p>Never till now had I felt any inconvenience from poverty; my
wants had all been amply supplied, and I had ever lived among,
and been highly loved and esteemed by, the first people of the
land.&nbsp; I was destitute, without aid, and undetermined how to
seek employment, or obtain fame.</p>
<p>At length I determined to travel on foot to Prussia to my
mother, and obtain money from her, and afterwards enter into the
Russian service.&nbsp; Schell, whose destiny was linked to mine,
would not forsake me.&nbsp; We assumed false names: I called
myself Knert, and Schell, Lesch; then, obtaining passports, like
common deserters, we left Braunau on the 21st of January, in the
evening, unseen of any person, and proceeded towards Bielitz in
Poland.&nbsp; A friend I had at Neurode gave me a pair of pocket
pistols, a musket, and three ducats; the money was spent at
Braunau.&nbsp; Here let me take occasion to remark I had lent
this friend, in urgent necessity, a hundred ducats, which he
still owed me; and when I sent to request payment, he returned me
three, as if I had asked charity.</p>
<p>Though a circumstantial description of our travels alone would
fill a volume, I shall only relate the most singular accidents
which happened to us; I shall also insert the journal of our
route, which Schell had preserved, and gave me in 1776, when he
came to see me at Aix-la-Chapelle, after an absence of thirty
years.</p>
<p>This may be called the first scene in which I appeared as an
adventurer, and perhaps my good fortune may even have
overbalanced the bad, since I have escaped death full thirty
times when the chances were a hundred to one against me; certain
it is I undertook many things in which I seemed to have owed my
preservation to the very rashness of the action, and in which
others equally brave would have found death.</p>
<h3>JOURNAL OF TRAVELS ON FOOT.</h3>
<p>From Braunau, in Bohemia, through Bielitz, in Poland, to
Meseritsch, and from Meseritsch, by Thorn, to Ebling; in the
whole 169 miles, <a name="citation3"></a><a href="#footnote3"
class="citation">[3]</a> performed without begging or
stealing.</p>
<p>January 18th, 1747.&mdash;From Braunau, by Politz, to Nachod,
three miles, we having three florins forty-five kreutzers in our
purse.</p>
<p>Jan. 19.&mdash;To Neustadt.&nbsp; Here Schell bartered his
uniform for an old coat, and a Jew gave him two florins fifteen
kreutzers in exchange; from hence we went to Reichenau; in all,
three miles.</p>
<p>Jan. 20.&mdash;We went to Leitomischl, five miles.&nbsp; Here
I bought a loaf hot out of the oven, which eating greedily, had
nearly caused my death.&nbsp; This obliged us to rest a day, and
the extravagant charge of the landlord almost emptied our
purse.</p>
<p>Jan. 22.&mdash;From Tr&uuml;bau, to Zwittau, in Moravia, four
miles.</p>
<p>Jan. 23.&mdash;To Sternberg, six miles.&nbsp; This day&rsquo;s
journey excessively fatigued poor Schell, his sprained ankle
being still extremely weak.</p>
<p>Jan. 24.&mdash;To Leipnik, four miles, in a deep snow, and
with empty stomachs.&nbsp; Here I sold my stock-buckle for four
florins.</p>
<p>Jan. 25.&mdash;To Freiberg, by Weiskirch, to Drahotusch, five
miles.&nbsp; Early in the morning we found a violin and case on
the road; the innkeeper in Weiskirch gave us two florins for it,
on condition that he should return it to the owner on proving his
right, it being worth at least twenty.</p>
<p>Jan. 26.&mdash;To Friedek, in Upper Silesia, two miles.</p>
<p>Jan. 27.&mdash;To a village, four miles and a half.</p>
<p>Jan. 28.&mdash;Through Skotschau, to Bielitz, three
miles.&nbsp; This was the last Austrian town on the frontiers of
Poland, and Captain Capi, of the regiment of Marischall, who
commanded the garrison, demanded our passports.&nbsp; We had
false names, and called ourselves common Prussian deserters; but
a drummer, who had deserted from Glatz, knew us, and betrayed us
to the captain, who immediately arrested us very rudely, and sent
us on foot to Teschin (refusing us a hearing), four miles
distant.</p>
<p>Here we found Lieut.-Colonel Baron Schwarzer, a perfectly
worthy man, who was highly interested in our behalf, and who
blamed the irregular arbitrary conduct of Captain Capi.&nbsp; I
frankly related my adventures, and he used every possible
argument to persuade me, instead of continuing my journey through
Poland to go to Vienna, but in vain; my good genius, this time,
preserved me&mdash;would to God it ever had!&nbsp; How many
miseries had I then avoided, and how easily might I have escaped
the snares spread for me by the powerful, who have seized on my
property, and in order to secure it, have hitherto rendered me
useless to the state by depriving me of all post or
preferment.</p>
<p>I returned, therefore, a second time to Beilitz, travelling
these four miles once more.&nbsp; Schwarzer lent us his own horse
and four ducats, which I have since repaid, but which I shall
never forget, as they were of signal service to me, and procured
me a pair of new boots.</p>
<p>Irritated against Captain Capi, we passed through Beilitz
without stopping, went immediately to Biala, the first town in
Poland, and from thence sent Capi a challenge to fight me, with
sword or pistol, but received no answer; and his non-appearance
has ever confirmed him in my opinion a rascal.</p>
<p>And here suffer me to take a retrospective view of what was my
then situation.&nbsp; By the orders of Capi I was sent prisoner
as a contemptible common deserter, and was unable to call him to
account.&nbsp; In Poland, indeed, I had that power, but was
despised as a vagabond because of my poverty.&nbsp; What, alas!
are the advantages which the love of honour, science, courage, or
desire of fame can bestow, wanting the means that should
introduce us to, and bid us walk erect in the presence of our
equals?&nbsp; Youth depressed by poverty, is robbed of the
society of those who best can afford example and
instruction.&nbsp; I had lived familiar with the great, men of
genius had formed and enlightened me; I had been enumerated among
the favourites of a court; and now was I a stranger, unknown,
unesteemed, nay, condemned, obliged to endure the extremes of
cold, hunger, and thirst; to wander many a weary mile, suffering
both in body and mind, while every step led me farther from her
whom most I loved, and dearest; yet had I no fixed plan, no
certain knowledge in what these my labours and sufferings should
end.</p>
<p>I was too proud to discover myself; and, indeed, to whom could
I discover myself in a strange land?&nbsp; My name might have
availed me in Austria, but in Austria, where this name was known,
would I not remain; rather than seek my fortune there, I was
determined to shun whatever might tend to render me suspicious in
the eyes of my country.&nbsp; How liable was a temper so ardent
as mine, in the midst of difficulties, fatigues, and
disappointments, hard to endure, to betray me into all those
errors of which rash youth, unaccustomed to hardship, impatient
of contrariety, are so often guilty!&nbsp; But I had taken my
resolution, and my faithful Schell, to whom hunger or ease,
contempt or fame, for my sake, were become indifferent, did
whatever I desired.</p>
<p>Once more to my journal.</p>
<p>Feb. 1.&mdash;We proceeded four miles from Biala to Oswintzen,
I having determined to ask aid from my sister, who had married
Waldow, and lived much at her case on a fine estate at Hanmer, in
Brandenburg, between Lansberg, on the Warta and Meseritsch, a
frontier town of Poland.&nbsp; For this reason we continued our
route all along the Silesian confines to Meseritsch.</p>
<p>Feb. 2.&mdash;To Bobrek and Elkusch, five miles.&nbsp; We
suffered much this day because of the snow, and that the
lightness of our dress was ill suited to such severe
weather.&nbsp; Schell, negligently, lost our purse, in which were
nine florins.&nbsp; I had still, however, nineteen grosch in my
pocket (about half-a-crown).</p>
<p>Feb. 3.&mdash;To Crumelew, three miles; and</p>
<p>Feb. 4.&mdash;To Wladowiegud Joreck, three miles more; and
from thence, on.</p>
<p>Feb. 5.&mdash;To Czenstochowa, where there is a magnificent
convent, concerning which, had I room, I might write many
remarkable things, much to the disgrace of its inhabitants.</p>
<p>We slept at an inn kept by a very worthy man, whose name was
Lazar.&nbsp; He had been a lieutenant in the Austrian service,
where he had suffered much, and was now become a poor innkeeper
in Poland.&nbsp; We had not a penny in our purse, and requested a
bit of bread.&nbsp; The generous man had compassion on us, and
desired us to sit down and eat with himself.&nbsp; I then told
him who we were, and trusted him with the motives of our
journey.&nbsp; Scarcely had we supped, before a carriage arrived
with three people.&nbsp; They had their own horses, a servant and
a coachman.</p>
<p>This is a remarkable incident, and I must relate it
circumstantially, though as briefly as possible.</p>
<p>We had before met this carriage at Elkusch, and one of these
people had asked Schell where we were going; he had replied, to
Czenstochowa; we therefore had not the least suspicion of them,
notwithstanding the danger we ran.</p>
<p>They lay at the inn, saluted us, but with indifference, not
seeming to notice us, and spoke little.&nbsp; We had not been
long in bed, before our host came to awaken us, and told us with
surprise, these pretended merchants were sent to arrest us from
Prussia; that they had offered, first, fifty, afterwards, a
hundred ducats, if he would permit them to take us in his house,
and carry us into Silesia: that he had firmly rejected the
proposal, though they had increased their promises: and that at
last they had given him six ducats to engage his silence.</p>
<p>We clearly saw these were an officer and under-officers sent
by General Fouquet, to recover us.&nbsp; We conjectured by what
means they had discovered our route, and imagined the information
they had received could only come from one Lieutenant Molinie, of
the garrison of Habelschwert, who had come to visit Schell, as a
friend, during our stay at Braunau.&nbsp; He had remained with us
two days, and had asked many questions concerning the road we
should take, and he was the only one who knew it.&nbsp; He was
probably the spy of Fouquet, and the cause of what happened
afterwards, which, however, ended in the defeat of our
enemies.</p>
<p>The moment I heard of this infamous treachery, I was for
entering with my pistols primed, into the enemy&rsquo;s chamber,
but was prevented by Schell and Lazar: the latter entreated me,
in the strongest manner, to remain at his house till I should
receive a supply from my mother, that I might be enabled to
continue my journey with more ease and less danger: but his
entreaties were ineffectual; I was determined to see her,
uncertain as I was of what effect my letter had produced.&nbsp;
Lazar assured me, we should, most infallibly, be attacked on the
road.&nbsp; &ldquo;So much the better,&rdquo; retorted I;
&ldquo;that will give me an opportunity of despatching them,
sending them to the other world, and shooting them as I would
highwayman.&rdquo;&nbsp; They departed at break of day, and took
the road to Warsaw.</p>
<p>We would have been gone, likewise, but Lazar, in some sort,
forcibly detained us, and gave us the six ducats he had received
from the Prussians, with which we bought us each a shirt, another
pair of pocket pistols, and other urgent necessaries; then took
an affectionate leave of our host, who directed us on our way,
and we testified our gratitude for the great services done
us.</p>
<p>Feb. 6.&mdash;From Czenstochowa to Dankow, two miles.&nbsp;
Here we expected an attack.&nbsp; Lazar had told us our enemies
had one musket: I also had a musket, and an excellent sabre, and
each of us was provided with a pair of pistols.&nbsp; They knew
not we were so well armed, which perhaps was the cause of their
panic, when they came to engage.</p>
<p>Feb. 7.&mdash;We took the road to Parsemechi: we had not been
an hour on the road, before we saw a carriage; as we drew near,
we knew it to be that of our enemies, who pretended it was set in
the snow.&nbsp; They were round it, and when they saw us
approach, began to call for help.&nbsp; This, we guessed, was an
artifice to entrap us.&nbsp; Schell was not strong; they would
all have fallen upon me, and we should easily have been carried
off, for they wanted to take us alive.</p>
<p>We left the causeway about thirty paces,
answering&mdash;&ldquo;we had not time to give them help;&rdquo;
at which they all ran to their carriage, drew out their pistols,
and returning full speed after us, called, &ldquo;Stop,
rascals!&rdquo;&nbsp; We began to run, but I suddenly turning
round, presented my piece, and shot the nearest dead on the
spot.&nbsp; Schell fired his pistols; our oppressors did the
same, and Schell received a ball in the neck at this
discharge.&nbsp; It was now my turn; I took out my pistols, one
of the assailants fled, and I enraged, pursued him three hundred
paces, overtook him, and as he was defending himself with his
sword, perceiving he bled, and made a feeble resistance, pressed
upon him, and gave him a stroke that brought him down.&nbsp; I
instantly returned to Schell, whom I found in the power of two
others that were dragging him towards the carriage, but when they
saw me at their heels, they fled over the fields.&nbsp; The
coachman, perceiving which way the battle went, leaped on his
box, and drove off full speed.</p>
<p>Schell, though delivered, was wounded with a ball in the neck,
and by a cut in the right hand, which had made him drop his
sword, though he affirmed he had run one of his adversaries
through.</p>
<p>I took a silver watch from the man I had killed, and was going
to make free with his purse, when Schell called, and showed me a
coach and six coming down a hill.&nbsp; To stay would have
exposed us to have been imprisoned as highwaymen; for the two
fugitives who had escaped us would certainly have borne witness
against us.&nbsp; Safety could only be found in flight.&nbsp; I,
however, seized the musket and hat of him I had first killed, and
we then gained the copse, and after that the forest.&nbsp; The
road was round about, and it was night before we reached
Parsemechi.</p>
<p>Schell was besmeared with blood; I had bound up his wound the
best I could; but in Polish villages no surgeons are to be found:
and he performed his journey with great difficulty.&nbsp; We met
with two Saxon under-officers here, who were recruiting for the
regiment of guards at Dresden.&nbsp; My six feet height and
person pleased them, and they immediately made themselves
acquainted with me.&nbsp; I found them intelligent, and entrusted
them with our secret, told them who we were, related the battle
we had that day had with our pursuers, and I had not reason to
repent of my confidence in them.&nbsp; Schell had his wounds
dressed, and we remained seven days with these good Saxons, who
faithfully kept us company.</p>
<p>I learned, meantime, that of the four men by whom we had been
assaulted, one only, and the coachman, returned to Glatz.&nbsp;
The name of the officer who undertook this vile business was
Gersdorf; he had a hundred and fifty ducats in his pocket when
found dead.&nbsp; How great would our good fortune have been, had
not that cursed coach and six, by its appearance, made us take to
flight; since the booty would have been most just!&nbsp; Fortune,
this time, did not favour the innocent; and though treacherously
attacked, I was obliged to escape like a guilty wretch.&nbsp; We
sold the watch to a Jew for four ducats, the hat for three
florins and a half, and the musket for a ducat, Schell being
unable to carry it farther.&nbsp; We left most of this money
behind us at Parsemechi.&nbsp; A Jew surgeon sold us some dear
plaisters, which we took with us and departed.</p>
<p>Feb. 15.&mdash;From Parsemechi, through Vielum, to Biala, four
miles.</p>
<p>Feb. 16.&mdash;Through Jerischow to Misorcen, four miles and a
half.</p>
<p>Feb. 17.&mdash;To Osterkow and Schwarzwald, three miles.</p>
<p>Feb. 18.&mdash;To Sdune, four miles.</p>
<p>Feb. 19.&mdash;To Goblin two miles.</p>
<p>Here we arrived wholly destitute of money.&nbsp; I sold my
coat to a Jew, who gave me four florins and a coarse
waggoner&rsquo;s frock, in exchange, which I did not think I
should long need, as we now drew nearer to where my sister lived,
and where I hoped I should be better equipped.&nbsp; Schell,
however, grew weaker and weaker; his wounds healed slowly, and
were expensive; the cold was also injurious to him, and, as he
was not by nature cleanly in his person, his body soon became the
harbour of every species of vermin to be picked up in
Poland.&nbsp; We often arrived wet and weary, to our smoky,
reeking stove-room.&nbsp; Often were we obliged to lie on straw,
or bare boards; and the various hardships we suffered are almost
incredible.&nbsp; Wandering as we did, in the midst of winter,
through Poland, where humanity, hospitality, and gentle pity, are
scarcely so much as known by name; where merciless Jews deny the
poor traveller a bed, and where we disconsolately strayed,
without bread, and almost naked: these were sufferings, the full
extent of which he only can conceive by whom they have been
felt.&nbsp; My musket now and then procured us an occasional meal
of tame geese, and cocks and hens, when these were to be had;
otherwise, we never took or touched anything that was not our
own.&nbsp; We met with Saxon and Prussian recruiters at various
places; all of whom, on account of my youth and stature, were
eager to inveigle me.&nbsp; I was highly diverted to hear them
enumerate all the possibilities of future greatness, and how
liable I was hereafter to become a corporal: nor was I less merry
with their mead, ale, and brandy, given with an intent to make me
drunk.&nbsp; Thus we had many artifices to guard against; but
thus had we likewise, very luckily for us, many a good meal
gratis.</p>
<p>Feb. 21.&mdash;We went from Goblin to Pugnitz, three miles and
a half.</p>
<p>Feb. 22.&mdash;Through Storchnest to Schmiegel, four
miles.</p>
<p>Here happened a singular adventure.&nbsp; The peasants at this
place were dancing to a vile scraper on the violin: I took the
instrument myself, and played while they continued their
hilarity.&nbsp; They were much pleased with my playing: but when
I was tired, and desired to have done, they obliged me, first by
importunities, and afterwards by threats, to play on all
night.&nbsp; I was so fatigued, I thought I should have fainted;
at length they quarrelled among themselves.&nbsp; Schell was
sleeping on a bench, and some of them fell upon his wounded hand:
he rose furious: I seized our arms, began to lay about me, and
while all was in confusion, we escaped, without further
ill-treatment.</p>
<p>What ample subject of meditation on the various turns of fate
did this night afford!&nbsp; But two years before I danced at
Berlin with the daughters and sisters of kings: and here was I,
in a Polish hut, a ragged, almost naked musician, playing for the
sport of ignorant rustics, whom I was at last obliged to
fight.</p>
<p>I was myself the cause of the trifling misfortune that befell
me on this occasion.&nbsp; Had not my vanity led me to show these
poor peasants I was a musician, I might have slept in peace and
safety.&nbsp; The same vain desire of proving I knew more than
other men, made me through life the continued victim of envy and
slander.&nbsp; Had nature, too, bestowed on me a weaker or a
deformed body, I had been less observed, less courted, less
sought, and my adventures and mishaps had been fewer.&nbsp; Thus
the merits of the man often become his miseries; and thus the
bear, having learned to dance, must live and die in chains.</p>
<p>This ardour, this vanity, or, if you please, this emulation,
has, however, taught me to vanquish a thousand difficulties,
under which others of cooler passions and more temperate desires
would have sunk.&nbsp; May my example remain a warning; and thus
may my sufferings become somewhat profitable to the world, cruel
as they have been to myself!&nbsp; Cruel they were, and cruel
they must continue; for the wounds I have received are not, will
not, cannot be healed.</p>
<p>Feb. 23.&mdash;From Schmiegel to Rakonitz, and from thence to
Karger Holland, four miles and a half.&nbsp; Here we sold, to
prevent dying of hunger, a shirt and Schell&rsquo;s waistcoat for
eighteen grosch, or nine schostacks.&nbsp; I had shot a pullet
the day before, which necessity obliged us to eat raw.&nbsp; I
also killed a crow, which I devoured alone, Schell refusing to
taste.&nbsp; Youth and hard travelling created a voracious
appetite, and our eighteen grosch were soon expended.</p>
<p>Feb. 24.&mdash;We came through Benzen to Lettel, four
miles.&nbsp; Here we halted a day, to learn the road to Hammer,
in Brandenburg, where my sister lived.&nbsp; I happened luckily
to meet with the wife of a Prussian soldier who lived at Lettel,
and belonged to Kolschen, where she was born a vassal of my
sister&rsquo;s husband.&nbsp; I told her who I was, and she
became our guide.</p>
<p>Feb. 26.&mdash;To Kurschen and Falkenwalde.</p>
<p>Feb. 27.&mdash;Through Neuendorf and Oost, and afterwards
through a pathless wood, five miles and a half to Hammer, and
here I knocked at my sister&rsquo;s door at nine o&rsquo;clock in
the evening.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>
<p>A maidservant came to the door, whom I knew; her name was
Mary, and she had been born and brought up in my father&rsquo;s
house.&nbsp; She was terrified at seeing a sturdy fellow in a
beggar&rsquo;s dress; which perceiving, I asked, &ldquo;Molly, do
not you know me?&rdquo;&nbsp; She answered, &ldquo;No;&rdquo; and
I then discovered myself to her.&nbsp; I asked whether my
brother-in-law was at home.&nbsp; Mary replied, &ldquo;Yes; but
he is sick in bed.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Tell my sister,
then,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that I am here.&rdquo;&nbsp; She
showed me into a room, and my sister presently came.</p>
<p>She was alarmed at seeing me, not knowing that I had escaped
from Glatz, and ran to inform her husband, but did not
return.</p>
<p>A quarter of an hour after the good Mary came weeping, and
told us her master commanded us to quit the premises instantly,
or he should be obliged to have us arrested, and delivered up as
prisoners.&nbsp; My sister&rsquo;s husband forcibly detained her,
and I saw her no more.</p>
<p>What my feelings must be, at such a moment, let the reader
imagine.&nbsp; I was too proud, too enraged, to ask money; I
furiously left the house, uttering a thousand menaces against its
inhabitants, while the kind-hearted Mary, still weeping, slipped
three ducats into my hand, which I accepted.</p>
<p>And, now behold us once more in the wood, which was not above
a hundred paces from the house, half dead with hunger and
fatigue, not daring to enter any habitation, while in the states
of Brandenburg, and dragging our weary steps all night through
snow and rain, until our guide at length brought us back, at
daybreak, once again to the town of Lettel.</p>
<p>She herself wept in pity at our fate, and I could only give
her two ducats for the danger she had run; but I bade her hope
more in future; and I afterwards sent for her to Vienna, in 1751,
where I took great care of her.&nbsp; She was about fifty years
of age, and died my servant in Hungary, some weeks before my
unfortunate journey to Dantzic, where I fell into my
enemies&rsquo; hands, and remained ten years a prisoner at
Magdeburg.</p>
<p>We had scarcely reached the wood, before, in the anguish of my
heart, I exclaimed to Schell, &ldquo;Does not such a sister, my
friend, deserve I should fire her house over her
head?&rdquo;&nbsp; The wisdom of moderation, and calm
forbearance, was in Schell a virtue of the highest order; he was
my continual mentor; my guide, whenever my choleric temperament
was disposed to violence.&nbsp; I therefore honour his ashes; he
deserved a better fate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Friend,&rdquo; said he, on this occasion,
&ldquo;reflect that your sister may be innocent, may be withheld
by her husband; besides, should the King discover we had entered
her doors, and she had not delivered us again into his power, she
might become as miserable as we were.&nbsp; Be more noble minded,
and think that even should your sister be wrong, the time may
come when her children may stand in need of your assistance, and
you may have the indescribable pleasure of returning good for
evil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I never shall forget this excellent advice, which in reality
was a prophecy.&nbsp; My rich brother-in-law died, and, during
the Russian war, his lands and houses were laid desolate and in
ruins; and, nineteen years afterwards, when released from my
imprisonment at Magdeburg, I had an opportunity of serving the
children of my sister.&nbsp; Such are the turns of fate; and thus
do improbabilities become facts.</p>
<p>My sister justified her conduct; Schell had conjectured the
truth; for ten years after I was thus expelled her house, she
showed, during my imprisonment, she was really a sister.&nbsp;
She was shamefully betrayed by Weingarten, secretary to the
Austrian ambassador at Berlin; lost a part of her property, and
at length her life fell an innocent sacrifice to her brother.</p>
<p>This event, which is interwoven with my tragical history, will
be related hereafter: my heart bleeds, my very soul shudders,
when I recollect this dreadful scene.</p>
<p>I have not the means fully to recompense her children; and
Weingarten, the just object of vengeance, is long since in the
grave; for did he exist, the earth should not hide him from my
sword.</p>
<p>I shall now continue my journal: deceived in the aid I
expected, I was obliged to change my plan, and go to my mother,
who lived in Prussia, nine miles beyond K&ouml;nigsberg.</p>
<p>Feb. 28.&mdash;We continued, tired, anxious, and distressed,
at Lettel.</p>
<p>March 1.&mdash;We went three miles to Pleese, and on the 2nd,
a mile and a half farther to Meseritz.</p>
<p>March 3.&mdash;Through Wersebaum to Birnbaum, three miles.</p>
<p>March 4.&mdash;Through Zircke, Wruneck, Obestchow, to
Stubnitz, seven miles, in one day, three of which we had the good
fortune to ride.</p>
<p>March 5.&mdash;Three miles to Rogosen, where we arrived
without so much as a heller to pay our lodgings.&nbsp; The Jew
innkeeper drove us out of his house; we were obliged to wander
all night, and at break of day found we had strayed two miles out
of the road.</p>
<p>We entered a peasant&rsquo;s cottage, where an old woman was
drawing bread hot out of the oven.&nbsp; We had no money to
offer, and I felt, at this moment, the possibility even of
committing murder, for a morsel of bread, to satisfy the
intolerable cravings of hunger.&nbsp; Shuddering, with torment
inexpressible, at the thought, I hastened out of the door, and we
walked on two miles more to Wongrofze.</p>
<p>Here I sold my musket for a ducat, which had procured us many
a meal: such was the extremity of our distress.&nbsp; We then
satiated our appetites, after having been forty hours without
food or sleep, and having travelled ten miles in sleet and
snow.</p>
<p>March 6.&mdash;We rested, and came, on the 7th, through Genin,
to a village in the forest, four miles.</p>
<p>Here we fell in with a gang of gipsies (or rather banditti)
amounting to four hundred men, who dragged me to their
camp.&nbsp; They were mostly French and Prussian deserters, and
thinking me their equal, would force me to become one of their
hand.&nbsp; But, venturing to tell my story to their leader, he
presented me with a crown, gave us a small provision of bread and
meat, and suffered us to depart in peace, after having been four
and twenty hours in their company.</p>
<p>March 9.&mdash;We proceeded to Lapuschin, three miles and a
half; and the 10th to Thorn, four miles.</p>
<p>A new incident here happened, which showed I was destined, by
fortune, to a variety of adventures, and continually to struggle
with new difficulties.</p>
<p>There was a fair held at Thorn on the day of our
arrival.&nbsp; Suspicions might well arise, among the crowd, on
seeing a strong tall young man, wretchedly clothed, with a large
sabre by his side, and a pair of pistols in his girdle,
accompanied by another as poorly apparelled as himself, with his
hand and neck bound up, and armed likewise with pistols, so that
altogether he more resembled a spectre than a man.</p>
<p>We went to an inn, but were refused entertainment: I then
asked for the Jesuits&rsquo; college, where I inquired for the
father rector.&nbsp; They supposed at first I was a thief, come
to seek an asylum.&nbsp; After long waiting and much entreaty his
jesuitical highness at length made his appearance, and received
me as the Grand Mogul would his slave.&nbsp; My case certainly
was pitiable: I related all the events of my life, and the
purport of my journey; conjured him to save Schell, who was
unable to proceed further, and whose wounds grew daily worse; and
prayed him to entertain him at the convent till I should have
been to my mother, have obtained money, and returned to Thorn,
when I would certainly repay him whatever expense he might have
been at, with thanks and gratitude.</p>
<p>Never shall I forget the haughty insolence of this
priest.&nbsp; Scarcely would he listen to my humble request;
thou&rsquo;d and interrupted me continually, to tell me,
&ldquo;Be brief, I have more pressing affairs than
thine.&rdquo;&nbsp; In fine, I was turned away without obtaining
the least aid; and here I was first taught jesuitical pride; God
help the poor and honest man who shall need the assistance of
Jesuits!&nbsp; They, like all other monks, are seared to every
sentiment of human pity, and commiserate the distressed by taunts
and irony.</p>
<p>Four times in my life I have sought assistance and advice from
convents, and am convinced it is the duty of every honest man to
aid in erasing them from the face of the earth.</p>
<p>They succour rascals and murderers, that their power may be
idolised by the ignorant, and ostentatiously exert itself to
impede the course of law and justice; but in vain do the poor and
needy virtuous apply to them for help.</p>
<p>The reader will pardon my native hatred of hypocrisy and
falsehood, especially when he hears I have to thank the Jesuits
for the loss of all my great Hungarian estates.&nbsp; Father
Kampmuller, the bosom friend of the Count Grashalkowitz, was
confessor to the court of Vienna, and there was no possible kind
of persecution I did not suffer from priestcraft.&nbsp; Far from
being useful members of society, they take advantage of the
prejudices of superstition, exist for themselves alone, and
sacrifice every duty to the support of their own hierarchy, and
found a power, on error and ignorance, which is destructive of
all moral virtue.</p>
<p>Let us proceed.&nbsp; Mournful and angry, I left the college,
and went to my lodging-house, where I found a Prussian
recruiting-officer waiting for me, who used all his arts to
engage me to enlist; offering me five hundred dollars, and to
make me a corporal, if I could write.&nbsp; I pretended I was a
Livonian, who had deserted from the Austrians, to return home,
and claim an inheritance left me by my father.&nbsp; After much
persuasion, he at length told me in confidence, it was very well
known in the town that I was a robber; that I should soon be
taken before a magistrate, but that if I would enlist he would
ensure my safety.</p>
<p>This language was new to me; my passion rose instantaneously;
I remembered my name was Trenck, I struck him, and drew my sword;
but, instead of defending himself, he sprang out of the chamber,
charging the host not to let me quit the house.&nbsp; I knew the
town of Thorn had agreed with the King of Prussia, secretly, to
deliver up deserters, and began to fear the consequences.&nbsp;
Looking through the window, I presently saw two under Prussian
officers enter the house.&nbsp; Schell and I instantly flew to
our arms, and met the Prussians at the chamber door.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Make way,&rdquo; cried I, presenting my pistols.&nbsp; The
Prussian soldiers drew their swords, but retired with fear.&nbsp;
Going out of the house, I saw a Prussian lieutenant, in the
street, with the town-guard.&nbsp; These I overawed, likewise, by
the same means, and no one durst oppose me, though every one
cried, &ldquo;Stop thief!&rdquo;&nbsp; I came safely, however, to
the Jesuits&rsquo; convent; but poor Schell was taken, and
dragged to prison like a malefactor.</p>
<p>Half mad at not being able to rescue him, I imagined he must
soon be delivered up to the Prussians.&nbsp; My reception was
much better at the convent than it had been before, for they no
longer doubted but I was really a thief, who sought an
asylum.&nbsp; I addressed myself to one of the fathers, who
appeared to be a good kind of a man, relating briefly what had
happened, and entreated he would endeavour to discover why they
sought to molest us.</p>
<p>He went out, and returning in an hour after, told me,
&ldquo;Nobody knows you: a considerable theft was yesterday
committed at the fair: all suspicious persons are seized; you
entered the town accoutred like banditti.&nbsp; The man where you
put up is employed as a Prussian enlister, and has announced you
as suspicious people.&nbsp; The Prussian lieutenant therefore
laid complaint against you, and it was thought necessary to
secure your persons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My joy, at hearing this, was great.&nbsp; Our Moravian
passport, and the journal of our route, which I had in my pocket,
were full proofs of our innocence.&nbsp; I requested they would
send and inquire at the town where we lay the night before.&nbsp;
I soon convinced the Jesuit I spoke truth; he went, and presently
returned with one of the syndics, to whom I gave a more full
account of myself.&nbsp; The syndic examined Schell, and found
his story and mine agreed; besides which, our papers that they
had seized, declared who we were.&nbsp; I passed the night in the
convent without closing my eyes, revolving in my mind all the
rigours of my fate.&nbsp; I was still more disturbed for Schell,
who knew not where I was, but remained firmly persuaded we should
be conducted to Berlin; and, if so, determined to put a period to
his life.</p>
<p>My doubts were all ended at ten in the morning when my good
Jesuit arrived, and was followed by my friend Schell.&nbsp; The
judges, he said, had found us innocent, and declared us free to
go where we pleased; adding, however, that he advised us to be
upon our guard, we being watched by the Prussian enlisters; that
the lieutenant had hoped, by having us committed as thieves, to
oblige me to enter, and that he would account for all that had
happened.</p>
<p>I gave Schell a most affectionate welcome, who had been very
ill-used when led to prison, because he endeavoured to defend
himself with his left hand, and follow me.&nbsp; The people had
thrown mud at him, and called him a rascal that would soon be
hanged.&nbsp; Schell was little able to travel farther.&nbsp; The
father-rector sent us a ducat, but did not see us; and the chief
magistrate gave each of us a crown, by way of indemnification for
false imprisonment.&nbsp; Thus sent away, we returned to our
lodging, took our bundles, and immediately prepared to leave
Thorn.</p>
<p>As we went, I reflected that, on the road to Elbing, we must
pass through several Prussian villages, and inquired for a shop
where we might purchase a map.&nbsp; We were directed to an old
woman who sat at the door across the way, and were told she had a
good assortment, for that her son was a scholar.&nbsp; I
addressed myself to her, and my question pleased her, I having
added we were unfortunate travellers, who wished to find, by the
map, the road to Russia.&nbsp; She showed us into a chamber, laid
an atlas on the table, and placed herself opposite me, while I
examined the map, and endeavoured to hide a bit of a ragged
ruffle that had made its appearance.&nbsp; After steadfastly
looking at me, she at length exclaimed, with a sad and mournful
tone&mdash;&ldquo;Good God! who knows what is now become of my
poor son!&nbsp; I can see, sir, you too are of a good
family.&nbsp; My son would go and seek his fortune, and for these
eight years have I had no tidings of him.&nbsp; He must now be in
the Austrian cavalry.&rdquo;&nbsp; I asked in what
regiment.&nbsp; &ldquo;The regiment of Hohenhem; you are his very
picture.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Is he not of my height?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes, nearly.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Has he not light
hair?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, like yours, sir.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;What is his name?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;His name is
William.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No, my dear mother,&rdquo; cried I,
&ldquo;William is not dead; he was my best friend when I was with
the regiment.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here the poor woman could not contain
her joy.&nbsp; She threw herself round my neck, called me her
good angel who brought her happy tidings: asked me a thousand
questions which I easily contrived to make her answer herself,
and thus, forced by imperious necessity, bereft of all other
means, did I act the deceiver.</p>
<p>The story I made was nearly as follows:&mdash;I told her I was
a soldier in the regiment of Hohenhem, that I had a furlough to
go and see my father, and that I should return in a month, would
then take her letters, and undertake that, if she wished it, her
son should purchase his discharge, and once more come and live
with his mother.&nbsp; I added that I should be for ever and
infinitely obliged to her, if she would suffer my comrade,
meantime, to live at her house, he being wounded by the Prussian
recruiters, and unable to pursue his journey; that I would send
him money to come to me, or would myself come back and fetch him,
thankfully paying every expense.&nbsp; She joyfully consented,
told me her second husband, father-in-law to her dear William,
had driven him from home, that he might give what substance they
had to the younger son; and that the eldest had gone to
Magdeburg.&nbsp; She determined Schell should live at the house
of a friend, that her husband might know nothing of the matter;
and, not satisfied with this kindness, she made me eat with her,
gave me a new shirt, stockings, sufficient provisions for three
days, and six Lunenburg florins.&nbsp; I left Thorn, and my
faithful Schell, the same night, with the consolation that he was
well taken care of; and having parted from him with regret, went
on the 13th two miles further to Burglow.</p>
<p>I cannot describe what my sensations were, or the despondence
of my mind, when I thus saw myself wandering alone, and leaving,
forsaking, as it were, the dearest of friends.&nbsp; These may
certainly be numbered among the bitterest moments of my
life.&nbsp; Often was I ready to return, and drag him along with
me, though at last reason conquered sensibility.&nbsp; I drew
near the end of my journey, and was impelled forward by hope.</p>
<p>March 14.&mdash;I went to Schwetz, and</p>
<p>March 15.&mdash;To Neuburg and Mowe.&nbsp; In these two days I
travelled thirteen miles.&nbsp; I lay at Mowe, on some straw,
among a number of carters, and, when I awoke, perceived they had
taken my pistols, and what little money I had left, even to my
last penny.&nbsp; The gentlemen, however, were all gone.</p>
<p>What could I do?&nbsp; The innkeeper perhaps was privy to the
theft.&nbsp; My reckoning amounted to eighteen Polish
grosch.&nbsp; The surly landlord pretended to believe I had no
money when I entered his house, and I was obliged to give him the
only spare shirt I had, with a silk handkerchief, which the good
woman of Thorn had made me a present of, and to depart without a
single holler.</p>
<p>March 16.&mdash;I set off for Marienburg, but it was
impossible I should reach this place, and not fall into the hands
of the Prussians, if I did not cross the Vistula, and,
unfortunately, I had no money to pay the ferry, which would cost
two Polish schellings.</p>
<p>Full of anxiety, not knowing how to act, I saw two fishermen
in a boat, went to them, drew my sabre, and obliged them to land
me on the other side; when there, I took the oars from these
timid people, jumped out of the boat, pushed it off the shore,
and left it to drive with the stream.</p>
<p>To what dangers does not poverty expose man!&nbsp; These two
Polish schellings were not worth more than half a kreutzer, or
some halfpenny, yet was I driven by necessity to commit violence
on two poor men, who, had they been as desperate in their defence
as I was obliged to be in my attack, blood must have been spilled
and lives lost; hence it is evident that the degrees of guilt
ought to be strictly and minutely inquired into, and the degree
of punishment proportioned.&nbsp; Had I hewn them down with my
sabre, I should surely have been a murderer; but I should
likewise surely have been one of the most innocent of
murderers.&nbsp; Thus we see the value of money is not to be
estimated by any specific sum, small or great, but according to
its necessity and use.&nbsp; How little did I imagine when at
Berlin, and money was treated by me with luxurious neglect, I may
say, with contempt, I should be driven to the hard necessity, for
a sum so apparently despicable, of committing a violence which
might have had consequences so dreadful, and have led to the
commission of an act so atrocious!</p>
<p>I found Saxon and Prussian recruiters at Marion-burgh, with
whom, having no money, I ate, drank, listened to their proposals,
gave them hopes for the morrow, and departed by daybreak.</p>
<p>March 17.&mdash;To Elbing, four miles.</p>
<p>Here I met with my former worthy tutor, Brodowsky, who was
become a captain and auditor in the Polish regiment of
Golz.&nbsp; He met me just as I entered the town.&nbsp; I
followed triumphantly to his quarters; and here at length ended
the painful, long, and adventurous journey I had been obliged to
perform.</p>
<p>This good and kind gentleman, after providing me with
immediate necessaries, wrote so affectionately to my mother, that
she came to Elbing in a week, and gave me every aid of which I
stood in need.</p>
<p>The pleasure I had in meeting once more this tender mother,
whose qualities of heart and mind were equally excellent, was
inexpressible.&nbsp; She found a certain mode of conveying a
letter to my dear mistress at Berlin, who a short time after sent
me a bill of exchange for four hundred ducats upon Dantzic.&nbsp;
To this my mother added a thousand rix-dollars, and a diamond
cross worth nearly half as much, remained a fortnight with me,
and persisted, in spite of all remonstrance, in advising me to go
to Vienna.&nbsp; My determination had been fixed for Petersburg;
all my fears and apprehensions being awakened at the thought of
Vienna, and which indeed afterwards became the source of all my
cruel sufferings and sorrows.&nbsp; She would not yield in
opinion, and promised her future assistance only in case of my
obedience; it was my duty not to continue obstinate.&nbsp; Here
she left me, and I have never seen her since.&nbsp; She died in
1751, and I have ever held her memory in veneration.&nbsp; It was
a happiness for this affectionate mother that she did not hive to
be a witness of my afflictions in the year 1754.</p>
<p>An adventure, resembling that of Joseph in Egypt, happened to
me in Elbing.&nbsp; The wife of the worthy Brodowsky, a woman of
infinite personal attraction, grew partial to me; but I durst not
act ungratefully by my benefactor.&nbsp; Never to see me more was
too painful to her, and she even proposed to follow me, secretly,
to Vienna.&nbsp; I felt the danger of my situation, and doubted
whether Potiphar&rsquo;s wife offered temptations so strong as
Madame Brodowsky.&nbsp; I owned I had an affection for this lady,
but my passions were overawed.&nbsp; She preferred me to her
husband, who was in years, and very ordinary in person.&nbsp; Had
I yielded to the slightest degree of guilt, that of the present
enjoyment, a few days of pleasure must have been followed by
years of bitter repentance.</p>
<p>Having once more assumed my proper name and character, and
made presents of acknowledgment to the worthy tutor of my youth,
I became eager to return to Thorn.</p>
<p>How great was my joy at again meeting my honest Schell!&nbsp;
The kind old woman had treated him like a mother.&nbsp; She was
surprised, and half terrified, at seeing me enter in an
officer&rsquo;s uniform, and accompanied by two servants.&nbsp; I
gratefully and rapturously kissed her hand, repaid, with
thankfulness, every expense (for Schell had been nurtured with
truly maternal kindness), told her who I was, acknowledged the
deceit I had put upon her concerning her son, but faithfully
promised to give a true, and not fictitious account of him,
immediately on my arrival at Vienna.&nbsp; Schell was ready in
three days, and we left Thorn, came to Warsaw, and passed thence,
through Crakow, to Vienna.</p>
<p>I inquired for Captain Capi, at Bilitz, who had before given
me so kind a reception, and refused me satisfaction; but he was
gone, and I did not meet with him till some years after, when the
cunning Italian made me the most humble apologies for his
conduct.&nbsp; So goes the world.</p>
<p>My journey from Dantzic to Vienna would not furnish me with an
interesting page, though my travels on foot thither would have
afforded thrice as much as I have written, had I not been fearful
of trifling with the reader&rsquo;s patience.</p>
<p>In poverty one misfortune follows another.&nbsp; The
foot-passenger sees the world, becomes acquainted with it,
converses with men of every class.&nbsp; The lord luxuriously
lolls and slumbers in his carriage, while his servants pay
innkeepers and postillions, and passes rapidly over a kingdom, in
which he sees some dozen houses, called inns; and this he calls
travelling.&nbsp; I met with more adventures in this my journey
of 169 miles, than afterwards in almost as many thousand, when
travelling at ease, in a carriage.</p>
<p>Here, then, ends my journal, in which, from the hardships
therein related, and numerous others omitted, I seem a kind of
second Robinson Crusoe, and to have been prepared, by a gradual
increase and repetition of sufferings, to endure the load of
affliction which I was afterwards destined to bear.</p>
<p>Arrived at Vienna in the month of April, 1747.</p>
<p>And now another act of the tragedy is going to begin.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>
<p>After having defrayed the expenses of travelling for me and my
friend Schell, for whose remarkable history I will endeavour to
find a few pages in due course, I divided the three hundred
ducats which remained with him, and, having stayed a month at
Vienna, he went to join the regiment of Pallavicini, in which he
had obtained a lieutenant-colonel&rsquo;s commission, and which
was then in Italy.</p>
<p>Here I found my cousin, Baron Francis Trenck, the famous
partisan and colonel of pandours, imprisoned at the arsenal, and
involved in a most perplexing prosecution.</p>
<p>This Trenck was my father&rsquo;s brother&rsquo;s son.&nbsp;
His father had been a colonel and governor of Leitschau, and had
possessed considerable lordships in Sclavonia, those of
Pleternitz, Prestowacz, and Pakratz.&nbsp; After the siege of
Vienna, in 1683, he had left the Prussian service for that of
Austria, in which he remained sixty years.</p>
<p>That I may not here interrupt my story, I shall give some
account of the life of my cousin Baron Francis Trenck, so
renowned in the war of 1741, in another part, and who fell, at
last, the shameful sacrifice of envy and avarice, and received
the reward of all his great and faithful services in the prison
of the Spielberg.</p>
<p>The vindication of the family of the Trencks requires I should
speak of him; nor will I, in this, suffer restraint from the fear
of any man, however powerful.&nbsp; Those indeed who sacrificed a
man most ardent in his country&rsquo;s service to their own
private and selfish views, are now in their graves.</p>
<p>I shall insert no more of his history here than what is
interwoven with my own, and relate the rest in its proper
place.</p>
<p>A revision of his suit was at this time instituted.&nbsp;
Scarcely was I arrived in Vienna before his confidential agent,
M. Leber, presented me to Prince Charles and the Emperor; both
knew the services of Trenck, and the malice of his enemies;
therefore, permission for me to visit him in his prison, and
procure him such assistance as he might need, was readily
granted.&nbsp; On my second audience, the Emperor spoke so much
in my persecuted cousin&rsquo;s favour that I became highly
interested; he commanded me to have recourse to him on all
occasions; and, moreover, owned the president of the council of
war was a man of a very wicked character, and a declared enemy of
Trenck.&nbsp; This president was the Count of Lowenwalde, who,
with his associates, had been purposely selected as men proper to
oppress the best of subjects.</p>
<p>The suit soon took another face; the good Empress Queen, who
had been deceived, was soon better informed, and Trenck&rsquo;s
innocence appeared, on the revision of the process most
evidently.&nbsp; The trial, which had cost them twenty-seven
thousand florins, and the sentence which followed, were proved to
have been partial and unjust; and that sixteen of Trenck&rsquo;s
officers, who most of them had been broken for different
offences, had perjured themselves to insure his destruction.</p>
<p>It is a most remarkable circumstance that public notice was
given, in the <i>Vienna Gazette</i>, to the following
purport.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All those who have any complaints to make against
Trenck, let them appear, and they shall receive a ducat per day,
so long as the prosecution continues.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It will readily be imagined how fast his accusers would
increase, and what kind of people they were.&nbsp; The pay of
these witnesses alone amounted to fifteen thousand florins.&nbsp;
I now began the labour in concurrence with Doctor Gerhauer, and
the cause soon took another turn; but such was the state of
things, it would have been necessary to have broken all the
members of the council of war, as well as counsellor Weber, a man
of great power.&nbsp; Thus, unfortunately, politics began to
interfere with the course of justice.</p>
<p>The Empress Queen gave Trenck to understand she required he
should ask her pardon; and on that condition all proceedings
should be stopped, and he immediately set at liberty.&nbsp;
Prince Charles, who knew the court of Vienna, advised me also to
persuade my cousin to comply; but nothing could shake his
resolution.&nbsp; Feeling his right and innocence, he demanded
strict justice; and this made ruin more swift.</p>
<p>I soon learned Trenck must fall a sacrifice&mdash;he was
rich&mdash;his enemies already had divided among them more than
eighty thousand florins of his property, which was all
sequestered, and in their hands.&nbsp; They had treated him too
cruelly, and knew him too well, not to dread his vengeance the
moment he should recover his freedom.</p>
<p>I was moved to the soul at his sufferings, and as he had
vented public threats, at the prospect of approaching victory
over his enemies, they gained over the Court Confessor: and,
dreading him as they did, put every wily art in practice to
insure his destruction.&nbsp; I therefore, in the fulness of my
heart, made him the brotherly proposition of escaping, and,
having obtained his liberty, to prove his innocence to the
Empress Queen.&nbsp; I told him my plan, which might easily have
been put in execution, and which he seemed perfectly decided to
follow.</p>
<p>Some days after, I was ordered to wait on field-marshal Count
Konigseck, governor of Vienna.&nbsp; This respectable old
gentleman, whose memory I shall ever revere, behaved to me like a
father and the friend of humanity, advised me to abandon my
cousin, who he gave me clearly to understand had betrayed me by
having revealed my proposed plan of escape, willing to sacrifice
me to his ambition in order to justify the purity of his
intentions to the court, and show that, instead of wishing to
escape, he only desired justice.</p>
<p>Confounded at the cowardly action of one for whom I would
willingly have sacrificed my life, and whom I only sought to
deliver, I resolved to leave him to his fate, and thought myself
exceedingly happy that the worthy field-marshal would, after a
fatherly admonition, smother all farther inquiry into this
affair.</p>
<p>I related this black trait of ingratitude to Prince Charles of
Lorraine, who prevailed on me to again see my cousin, without
letting him know I knew what had passed, and still to render him
every service in my power.</p>
<p>Before I proceed I will here give the reader a
per-&rsquo;trait of this Trenck.</p>
<p>He was a man of superior talents and unbounded ambition;
devoted, even fanatically, to his sovereign; his boldness
approached temerity; he was artful of mind, wicked of heart,
vindictive and unfeeling.&nbsp; His cupidity equalled the utmost
excess of avarice, even in his thirty-third year, in which he
died.&nbsp; He was too proud to receive favours or obligations
from any man, and was capable of ridding himself of his best
friend if he thought he had any claims on his gratitude or could
get possession of his fortune.</p>
<p>He knew I had rendered him very important services, supposed
his cause already won, having bribed the judges, who were to
revise the sentence, with thirty thousand florins, which money I
received from his friend Baron Lopresti, and conveyed to these
honest counsellors.&nbsp; I knew all his secrets, and nothing
more was necessary to prompt his suspicious and bad heart to seek
my destruction.</p>
<p>Scarcely had a fortnight elapsed, after his having first
betrayed me, before the following remarkable event happened.</p>
<p>I left him one evening to return home, taking under my coat a
bag with papers and documents relating to the prosecution, which
I had been examining for him, and transcribing.&nbsp; There were
at this time about five-and-twenty officers in Vienna who had
laid complaints against him, and who considered me as their
greatest enemy because I had laboured earnestly in his
defence.&nbsp; I was therefore obliged, on all occasions, to be
upon my guard.&nbsp; A report had been propagated through Vienna
that I was secretly sent by the King of Prussia to free my cousin
from imprisonment; he, however, constantly denied, to the hour of
his death, his ever having written to me at Berlin; hence also it
will follow the letter I received had been forged by
Jaschinsky.</p>
<p>Leaving the Arsenal, I crossed the court, and perceived I was
closely followed by two men in grey roquelaures, who, pressing
upon my heels, held loud and insolent conversation concerning the
runaway Prussian Trenck.&nbsp; I found they sought a quarrel,
which was a thing of no great difficulty at that moment, for a
man is never more disposed to duelling than when he has nothing
to lose, and is discontented with his condition.&nbsp; I supposed
they were two of the accusing officers broken by Trenck, and
endeavoured to avoid them, and gain the Jew&rsquo;s place.</p>
<p>Scarcely had I turned down the street that leads thither
before they quickened their pace.&nbsp; I turned round, and in a
moment received a thrust with a sword in the left side, where I
had put my bag of papers, which accident alone saved my life; the
sword pierced through the papers and slightly grazed the
skin.&nbsp; I instantly drew, and the heroes ran.&nbsp; I
pursued, one of them tripped and fell.&nbsp; I seized him; the
guard came up: he declared he was an officer of the regiment of
Kollowrat, showed his uniform, was released, and I was taken to
prison.&nbsp; The Town Major came the next day, and told me I had
intentionally sought a quarrel with two officers, Lieutenants
F---g and K---n.&nbsp; These kind gentlemen did not reveal their
humane intention of sending me to the other world.</p>
<p>I was alone, could produce no witness, they were two.&nbsp; I
must necessarily be in the wrong, and I remained six days in
prison.&nbsp; No sooner was I released, than these my good
friends sent to demand satisfaction for the said pretended
insult.&nbsp; The proposal was accepted, and I promised to be at
the Scotch gate, the place appointed by them, within an
hour.&nbsp; Having heard their names, I presently knew them to be
two famous swaggerers, who were daily exercising themselves in
fencing at the Arsenal, and where they often visited
Trenck.&nbsp; I went to my cousin to ask his assistance, related
what had happened, and, as the consequences of this duel might be
very serious, desired him to give me a hundred ducats, that I
might be able to fly if either of them should fall.</p>
<p>Hitherto I had expended my own money on his account, and had
asked no reimbursement; but what was my astonishment when this
wicked man said to me, with a sneer, &ldquo;Since, good cousin,
you have got into a quarrel without consulting me, you will also
get out of it without my aid!&rdquo;&nbsp; As I left him, he
called me back to tell me, &ldquo;I will take care and pay your
undertaker;&rdquo; for he certainly believed I should never
return alive.</p>
<p>I ran now, half-despairing, to Baron Lopresti, who gave me
fifty ducats and a pair of pistols, provided with which I
cheerfully repaired to the field of battle.</p>
<p>Here I found half a dozen officers of the garrison.&nbsp; As I
had few acquaintances in Vienna, I had no second, except an old
Spanish invalid captain, named Pereyra, who met me going in all
haste, and, having learned whither, would not leave me.</p>
<p>Lieutenant K---n was the first with whom I fought, and who
received satisfaction by a deep wound in the right arm.&nbsp;
Hereupon I desired the spectators to prevent farther mischief;
for my own part I had nothing more to demand.&nbsp; Lieutenant
F---g next entered the lists, with threats, which were soon
quieted by a lunge in the belly.&nbsp; Hereupon Lieutenant M-f,
second to the first wounded man, told me very
angrily&mdash;&ldquo;Had I been your man, you would have found a
very different reception.&rdquo;&nbsp; My old Spaniard of eighty
proudly and immediately advanced, with his long whiskers and
tottering frame, and cried&mdash;&ldquo;Hold!&nbsp; Trenck has
proved himself a brave fellow, and if any man thinks proper to
assault him further, he must first take a breathing with
me.&rdquo;&nbsp; Everybody laughed at this bravado from a man who
scarcely could stand or hold a sword.&nbsp; I
replied&mdash;&ldquo;Friend, I am safe, unhurt, and want not aid;
should I be disabled, you then, if you think proper, may take my
place; but, as long as I can hold a sword, I shall take pleasure
in satisfying all these gentlemen one after another.&rdquo;&nbsp;
I would have rested myself a moment, but the haughty M-f, enraged
at the defeat of his friend, would not give me time, but
furiously attacked me, and, having been wounded twice, once in
the hand and again in the groin, he wanted to close and sink me
to the grave with himself, but I disarmed and threw him.</p>
<p>None of the others had any desire to renew the contest.&nbsp;
My three enemies were sent bleeding to town; and, as M---f
appeared to be mortally wounded, and the Jesuits and Capuchins of
Vienna refused me an asylum, I fled to the convent of
Keltenberg.</p>
<p>I wrote from the convent to Colonel Baron Lopresti, who came
to me.&nbsp; I told him all that had passed, and by his good
offices had liberty, in a week, to appear once more at
Vienna.</p>
<p>The blood of Lieutenant F---g was in a corrupt state, and his
wound, though not in itself dangerous, made his life
doubtful.&nbsp; He sent to entreat I would visit him, and, when I
went, having first requested I would pardon him, gave me to
understand I ought to beware of my cousin.&nbsp; I afterwards
learned the traitorous Trenck had promised Lieutenant F---g a
company and a thousand ducats if he would find means to quarrel
with me and rid the world of me.&nbsp; He was deeply in debt, and
sought the assistance of Lieutenant K-n; and had not the papers
luckily preserved me, I had undoubtedly been despatched by his
first lunge.&nbsp; To clear themselves of the infamy of such an
act, these two worthy gentlemen had pretended I had assaulted
them in the streets.</p>
<p>I could no more resolve to see my ungrateful and dangerous
kinsman, who wished to have me murdered because I knew all his
secrets, and thought he should be able to gain his cause without
obligation to me or my assistance.&nbsp; Notwithstanding all his
great qualities, his marked characteristic certainly was that of
sacrificing everything to his private views, and especially to
his covetousness, which was so great that, even at his time of
life, though his fortune amounted to a million and a half, he did
not spend per day more than thirty kreutzers.</p>
<p>No sooner was it known that I had forsaken Trenck than General
Count Lowenwalde, his most ardent enemy, and president of the
first council of war, by which he had been condemned, desired to
speak to me, promised every sort of good fortune and protection,
if I would discover what means had secretly been employed in the
revision of the process; and went so far as to offer me four
thousand florins if I would aid the prosecution against my
cousin.&nbsp; Here I learned the influence of villains in power,
and the injustice of judges at Vienna.&nbsp; The proposal I
rejected with disdain, and rather determined to seek my fortune
in the East Indies than continue in a country where, under the
best of Queens, the most loyal of subjects, and first of
soldiers, might be rendered miserable by interested, angry, and
corrupt courtiers.&nbsp; Certain it is, as I now can prove,
though the bitterest of my enemies, and whose conduct towards me
merited my whole resentment, he was the best soldier in the
Austrian army, had been liberal of his blood and fortune in the
Imperial service, and would still so have continued had not his
wealth, and his contempt for Weber and Lowenwalde put him in the
power of those wretches who were the avowed enemies of courage
and patriotism, and who only could maintain their authority, and
sate their thirst of gain, by the base and wicked arts of
courts.&nbsp; Had my cousin shared the plunder of the war among
these men, he had not fallen the martyr of their intrigues, and
died in the Spielberg.&nbsp; His accusers were, generally,
unprincipled men of ruined fortunes, and so insufficient were
their accusations that a useful member of society ought not, for
any or all of them, to have suffered an hour&rsquo;s
imprisonment.&nbsp; Being fully informed, both of all the
circumstances of the prosecution and the inmost secrets of his
heart, justice requires I should thus publicly declare this truth
and vindicate his memory.&nbsp; While living he was my bitterest
enemy, and even though dead, was the cause of all my future
sufferings; therefore the account I shall give of him will
certainly be the less liable to suspicion, where I shall show
that he, as well as myself, deserved better of Austria.</p>
<p>I was resolved forever to forsake Vienna.&nbsp; The friends of
Trenck all became distrustful of him because of his ingratitude
to me.&nbsp; Prince Charles still endeavoured to persuade me to a
reconciliation, and gave me a letter of recommendation to General
Brown, who then commanded the Imperial army in Italy.&nbsp; But
more anxious of going to India, I left Vienna in August, 1748,
desirous of owing no obligation to that city or its inhabitants,
and went for Holland.&nbsp; Meantime, the enemies of Trenck found
no one to oppose their iniquitous proceedings, and obtained a
sentence of imprisonment, in the Spielberg, where he too late
repented having betrayed his faithful adviser, and prudent
friend.&nbsp; I pitied him, and his judges certainly deserved the
punishment they inflicted: yet to his last moments he showed his
hatred towards me was rooted, and, even in the grave, strove by
his will to involve me in misfortune, as will hereafter be
seen.</p>
<p>I fled from Vienna, would to God it had been for ever; but
fate by strange ways, and unknown means, brought me back where
Providence thought proper I should become a vessel of wrath and
persecution: I was to enact my part in Europe, and not in
Asia.&nbsp; At Nuremberg I met with a body of Russians, commanded
by General Lieuwen, my mother&rsquo;s relation, who were marching
to the Netherlands, and were the peace-makers of Europe.&nbsp;
Major Buschkow, whom I had known when Russian resident at Vienna,
prevailed on me to visit him, and presented me to the
General.&nbsp; I pleased him, and may say, with truth, he behaved
to me like a friend and a father.&nbsp; He advised me to enter
into the Russian service, and gave me a company of dragoons, in
the regiment of Tobolski, on condition I should not leave him,
but employ myself in his cabinet: and his confidence and esteem
for me were unbounded.</p>
<p>Peace followed; the army returned to Moravia, without firing a
musket, and the head-quarters were fixed at Prosnitz.</p>
<p>In this town a public entertainment was given, by General
Lieuwen, on the coronation day of the Empress Elizabeth; and here
an adventure happened to me, which I shall ever remember, as a
warning to myself, and insert as a memento to others.</p>
<p>The army physician, on this day, kept a Faro bank for the
entertainment of the guests.&nbsp; My stock of money consisted of
two and twenty ducats.&nbsp; Thirst of gain, or perhaps example,
induced me to venture two of these, which I immediately lost, and
very soon, by venturing again to regain them, the whole two and
twenty.&nbsp; Chagrined at my folly, I returned home: I had
nothing but a pair of pistols left, for which, because of their
workmanship, General Woyekow had offered me twenty ducats.&nbsp;
These I took, intending by their aid to attempt to retrieve my
loss.&nbsp; Firing of guns and pistols was heard throughout the
town, because of the festival, and I, in imitation of the rest,
went to the window and fired mine.&nbsp; After a few discharges,
one of my pistols burst, and endangered my own hand, and wounded
my servant.&nbsp; I felt a momentary despondency, stronger than I
ever remember to have experienced before; insomuch that I was
half induced, with the remaining pistol, to shoot myself through
the head.&nbsp; I however, recovered my spirits, asked my servant
what money he had, and received from him three ducats.&nbsp; With
these I repaired, like a desperate gamester, once more to the
Faro table, at the General&rsquo;s, again began to play, and so
extraordinary was my run of luck, I won at every venture.&nbsp;
Having recovered my principal, I played on upon my winnings, till
at last I had absolutely broke the Doctor&rsquo;s bank: a new
bank was set up, and I won the greatest part of this likewise, so
that I brought home about six hundred ducats.</p>
<p>Rejoiced at my good fortune, but recollecting my danger, I had
the prudence to make a solemn resolution never more to play at
any game of chance, to which I have ever strictly adhered.</p>
<p>It were to be wished young men would reflect upon the effects
of gaming, remembering that the love of play has made the most
promising and virtuous, miserable; the honest, knaves; and the
sincere, deceivers and liars.&nbsp; Officers, having first lost
all their own money, being entrusted with the soldiers&rsquo;
pay, have next lost that also; and thus been cashiered, and
eternally disgraced.&nbsp; I might, at Prosnitz, have been
equally rash and culpable.&nbsp; The first venture, whether the
gamester wins or loses, ensures a second; and, with that, too
often destruction.&nbsp; My good fortune was almost miraculous,
and my subsequent resolution very uncommon; and I entreat and
conjure my children, when I shall no longer be living to advise
and watch for their welfare, most determinedly to avoid
play.&nbsp; I seemed preserved by Providence from this evil but
to endure much greater.</p>
<p>General Lieuwen, my kind patron, sent me, from Crakow, to
conduct a hundred and forty sick men down the Vistula to Dantzic,
where there were Russian vessels to receive and transport them to
Riga.</p>
<p>I requested permission of the General to proceed forward and
visit my mother and sister, whom I was very desirous to see: at
Elbing, therefore, I resigned the command to Lieutenant Platen,
and, attended by a servant, rode to the bishopric of Ermeland,
where I appointed an interview with them in a frontier
village.</p>
<p>Here an incident happened that had nearly cost me my
life.&nbsp; The Prussians, some days before, had carried off a
peasant&rsquo;s son from this village, as a recruit.&nbsp; The
people were all in commotion.&nbsp; I wore leathern breeches, and
the blue uniform of the Russian cavalry.&nbsp; They took me for a
Prussian, at the door, and fell upon me with every kind of
weapon.&nbsp; A chasseur, who happened to be there, and the
landlord, came to my assistance, while I, battling with the
peasants, had thrown two of them down.&nbsp; I was delivered, but
not till I had received two violent bruises, one on the left arm,
and another which broke the bridge of my nose.&nbsp; The landlord
advised me to escape as fast as possible, or that the village
would rise and certainly murder me; my servant, therefore, who
had retired for defence, with a pair of pistols, into the oven,
got ready the horses and we rode off.</p>
<p>I had my bruises dressed at the next village; my hand and eyes
were exceedingly swelled, but I was obliged to ride two miles
farther, to the town of Ressel, before I could find an able
surgeon, and here I so far recovered in a week, that I was able
to return to Dantzic.&nbsp; My brother visited me while at
Ressel, but my good mother had the misfortune, as she was coming
to me, to be thrown out of her carriage, by which her arm was
broken, so that she and my sister were obliged to return, and I
never saw her more.</p>
<p>I was now at Dantzic, with my sick convoy, where another most
remarkable event happened, which I, with good reason, shall ever
remember.</p>
<p>I became acquainted with a Prussian officer, whose name I
shall conceal out of respect to his very worthy family; he
visited me daily, and we often rode out together in the
neighbourhood of Dantzic.</p>
<p>My faithful servant became acquainted with his, and my
astonishment was indeed great when he one day said to me, with
anxiety, &ldquo;Beware, sir, of a snare laid for you by
Lieutenant N-; he means to entice you out of town and deliver you
up to the Prussians.&rdquo;&nbsp; I asked him where he learned
this.&nbsp; &ldquo;From the lieutenant&rsquo;s servant,&rdquo;
answered he, &ldquo;who is my friend, and wishes to save me from
misfortune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I now, with the aid of a couple of ducats, discovered the
whole affair, and learned it was agreed, between the Prussian
resident, Reimer, and the lieutenant, that the latter should
entice me into the suburb of Langfuhr, where there was an inn on
the Prussian territories.&nbsp; Here eight recruiting
under-officers were to wait concealed, and seize me the moment I
entered the house, hurry me into a carriage, and drive away for
Lauenberg in Pomerania.&nbsp; Two under-officers were to escort
me, on horseback, as far as the frontiers, and the remainder to
hold and prevent me from calling for help, so long as we should
remain on the territories of Dantzic.</p>
<p>I farther learned my enemies were only to be armed with
sabres, and that they were to wait behind the door.&nbsp; The two
officers on horseback were to secure my servant, and prevent him
from riding off and raising an alarm.</p>
<p>These preparations might easily have been rendered fruitless,
by my refusing to accept the proposal of the lieutenant, but
vanity gave me other advice, and resentment made me desirous of
avenging myself for such detestable treachery.</p>
<p>Lieutenant N--- came, about noon, to dine with me as usual,
was more pensive and serious than I had ever observed him before,
and left me at four in the afternoon, after having made a promise
to ride early next day with him as far as Langfuhr.&nbsp; I
observed my consent gave him great pleasure, and my heart then
pronounced sentence on the traitor.&nbsp; The moment he had left
me I went to the Russian resident, M. Scheerer, an honest Swiss,
related the whole conspiracy, and asked whether I might not take
six of the men under my command for my own personal
defence.&nbsp; I told him my plan, which he at first opposed; but
seeing me obstinate, he answered at last, &ldquo;Do as you
please; I must know nothing of the matter, nor will I make myself
responsible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I immediately joined my soldiers, selected six men, and took
them, while it was dark, opposite the Prussian inn, hid them in
the corn, with an order to run to my help with their firelocks
loaded the first discharge they should hear, to seize all who
should fall into their power, and only to fire in case of
resistance.&nbsp; I provided them with fire-arms, by concealing
them in the carriage which brought them to their
hiding-place.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding all these precautions, I still thought it
necessary to prevent surprise, by informing myself what were the
proceedings of my enemies, lest my intelligence should have been
false; and I learned from my spies that, at four in the morning,
the Prussian resident, Reimer, had left the city with post
horses.</p>
<p>I loaded mine and my servant&rsquo;s horse and pocket pistols,
prepared my Turkish sabre, and, in gratitude to the
lieutenant&rsquo;s man, promised to take him into my service,
being convinced of his honesty.</p>
<p>The lieutenant cheerfully entered about six in the morning,
expatiated on the fineness of the weather, and jocosely told me I
should be very kindly received by the handsome landlady of
Langfuhr.</p>
<p>I was soon ready; we mounted, and left the town, attended by
our servants.&nbsp; Some three hundred paces from the inn, my
worthy friend proposed that we should alight and let our servants
lead the horses, that we might enjoy the beauty of the
morning.&nbsp; I consented, and having dismounted, observed his
treacherous eyes sparkle with pleasure.</p>
<p>The resident, Reimer, was at the window of the inn, and called
out, as soon as he saw me, &ldquo;Good-morrow, captain,
good-morrow; come, come in, your breakfast is
waiting.&rdquo;&nbsp; I, sneering, smiled, and told him I had not
time at present.&nbsp; So saying, I continued my walk, but my
companion would absolutely force me to enter, took me by the arm,
and partly struggled with me, on which, losing all patience, I
gave him a blow which almost knocked him down, and ran to my
horses as if I meant to fly.</p>
<p>The Prussians instantly rushed from behind their door, with
clamour, to attack me.&nbsp; I fired at the first; my Russians
sprang from their hiding-place, presented their pieces, and
called, <i>Stuy</i>, <i>stuy</i>, <i>yebionnamat</i>.</p>
<p>The terror of the poor Prussians may well be supposed.&nbsp;
All began to run.&nbsp; I had taken care to make sure of my
lieutenant, and was next running to seize the resident, but he
had escaped out of the back door, with the loss only of his white
periwig.&nbsp; The Russians had taken four prisoners, and I
commanded them to bestow fifty strokes upon each of them in the
open street.&nbsp; An ensign, named Casseburg, having told me his
name, and that he had been my brother&rsquo;s schoolfellow,
begged remission, and excused himself on the necessity which he
was under to obey his superiors.&nbsp; I admitted his excuses and
suffered him to go.&nbsp; I then drew my sword and bade the
lieutenant defend himself; but he was so confused, that, after
drawing his sword, he asked my pardon, laid the whole blame upon
the resident, and had not the power to put himself on his
guard.&nbsp; I twice jerked his sword out of his hand, and, at
last, taking the Russian corporal&rsquo;s cane, I exhausted my
strength with beating him, without his offering the least
resistance.&nbsp; Such is the meanness of detected
treachery.&nbsp; I left him kneeling, saying to him, &ldquo;Go,
rascal, now, and tell your comrades the manner in which Trenck
punishes robbers on the highway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The people had assembled round us during the action, to whom I
related the affair, and the attack having happened on the
territories of Dantzic, the Prussians were in danger of being
stoned by the populace.&nbsp; I and my Russians marched off
victorious, proceeded to the harbour, embarked, and three or four
days after, set sail for Riga.</p>
<p>It is remarkable that none of the public papers took any
notice of this affair; no satisfaction was required.&nbsp; The
Prussians, no doubt, were ashamed of being defeated in an attempt
so perfidious.</p>
<p>I since have learnt that Frederic, no doubt by the false
representations of Reimer, was highly irritated, and what
afterwards happened proves his anger pursued me through every
corner of the earth, till at last I fell into his power at
Dantzic, and suffered a martyrdom most unmerited and
unexampled.</p>
<p>The Prussian envoy, Goltz, indeed, made complaints to Count
Bestuchef, concerning this Dantzic skirmish, but received no
satisfaction.&nbsp; My conduct was justified in Russia, I having
defended myself against assassins, as a Russian captain
ought.</p>
<p>Some dispassionate readers may blame me for not having avoided
this rencontre, and demanded personal satisfaction of Lieutenant
N---.&nbsp; But I have through life rather sought than avoided
danger.&nbsp; My vanity and revenge were both roused.&nbsp; I was
everywhere persecuted by the Prussians, and I was therefore
determined to show that, far from fearing, I was able to defend
myself.</p>
<p>I hired the servant of the lieutenant, whom I found honest and
faithful, and whom I comfortably settled in marriage, at Vienna,
in 1753.&nbsp; After my ten years&rsquo; imprisonment, I found
him poor, and again took him into my service, in which he died,
at Zwerbach, in 1779.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>
<p>And now behold me at sea, on my voyage to Riga.&nbsp; I had
eaten heartily before I went on board; a storm came on; I worked
half the night, to aid the crew, but at length became sea-sick,
and went to lie down.&nbsp; Scarcely had I closed my eyes before
the master came with the joyful tidings, as he thought, that we
were running for the port of Pillau.&nbsp; Far from pleasing,
this, to me, was dreadful intelligence.&nbsp; I ran on deck, saw
the harbour right before me, and a pilot coming off.&nbsp; The
sea must now be either kept in a storm, or I fall into the hands
of the Prussians; for I was known to the whole garrison of
Pillau.</p>
<p>I desired the captain to tack about and keep the sea, but he
would not listen to me.&nbsp; Perceiving this, I flew to my
cabin, snatched my pistols, returned, seized the helm, and
threatened the captain with instant death if he did not
obey.&nbsp; My Russians began to murmur; they were averse to
encountering the dangers of the storm, but luckily they were
still more averse to meet my anger, overawed, as they were, by my
pistols, and my two servants, who stood by me faithfully.</p>
<p>Half an hour after, the storm began to subside, and we
fortunately arrived the next day in the harbour of Riga.&nbsp;
The captain, however, could not be appeased, but accused me
before the old and honourable Marshal Lacy, then governor of
Riga.&nbsp; I was obliged to appear, and reply to the charge by
relating the truth.&nbsp; The governor answered, my obstinacy
might have occasioned the death of a hundred and sixty persons;
I, smiling, retorted, &ldquo;I have brought them all safe to
port, please your Excellency; and, for my part, my fate would
have been much more merciful by falling into the hands of my God
than into the hands of my enemies.&nbsp; My danger was so great
that I forgot the danger of others; besides, sir, I knew my
comrades were soldiers, and feared death as little as I
do.&rdquo;&nbsp; My answer pleased the fine grey-headed general,
and he gave me a recommendation to the chancellor Bestuchef at
Moscow.</p>
<p>General Lieuwen had marched from Moravia, for Russia, with the
army, and was then at Riga.&nbsp; I went to pay him my respects;
he kindly received me, and took me to one of his seats, named
Annaburg, four miles from Riga.&nbsp; Here I remained some days,
and he gave me every recommendation to Moscow, where the court
then was.&nbsp; It was intended I should endeavour to obtain a
company in the regiment of cuirassiers, the captains of which
then ranked as majors, and he advised me to throw up my
commission in the Siberian regiment of Tobolski dragoons.&nbsp;
Peace be to the names and the memory of this worthy man!&nbsp;
May God reward this benevolence!&nbsp; From Riga I departed, in
company with M. Oettinger, lieutenant-colonel of engineers, and
Lieutenant Weismann, for Moscow.&nbsp; This is the same Weismann
who rendered so many important services to Russia, during the
last war with the Turks.</p>
<p>On my arrival, after delivering in my letters of
recommendation, I was particularly well received by Count
Bestuchef.&nbsp; Oettinger, whose friendship I had gained, was
exceedingly intimate with the chancellor, and my interest was
thereby promoted.</p>
<p>I had not been long at Moscow before I met Count Hamilton, my
former friend during my abode at Vienna.&nbsp; He was a captain
of cavalry, in the regiment of General Bernes, who had been sent
as imperial ambassador to Russia.</p>
<p>Bernes had been ambassador at Berlin in 1743, where he had
consequently known me during the height of my favour at the court
of Frederic.&nbsp; Hamilton presented me to him, and I had the
good fortune so far to gain his friendship, that, after a few
visits, he endeavoured to detach me from the Russian service,
offering me the strongest recommendations to Vienna, and a
company in his own regiment.&nbsp; My cousin&rsquo;s misfortunes,
however, had left too deep an impression on my mind to follow his
advice.&nbsp; The Indies would then have been preferred by me to
Austria.</p>
<p>Bernes invited me to dine with him in company with his bosom
friend, Lord Hyndford, the English ambassador.&nbsp; How great
was the pleasure I that day received!&nbsp; This eminent
statesman had known me at Berlin, and was present when Frederic
had honoured me with saying, <i>C&rsquo;est un matador de ma
jeunesse</i>.&nbsp; He was well read in men, conceived a good
opinion of my abilities, and became a friend and father to
me.&nbsp; He seated me by his side at table, and asked me,
&ldquo;Why came you here, Trenck?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;In search
of bread and honour, my lord,&rdquo; answered I, &ldquo;having
unmeritedly lost them both in my own country.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
further inquired the state of my finances; I told him my whole
store might be some thirty ducats.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take my counsel,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;you have the
necessary qualifications to succeed in Russia, but the people
here despise poverty, judge from the exterior only, and do not
include services or talents in the estimate; you must have the
appearance of being wealthy.&nbsp; I and Bernes will introduce
you into the best families, and will supply you with the
necessary means of support.&nbsp; Splendid liveries, led horses,
diamond rings, deep play, a bold front, undaunted freedom with
statesmen, and gallantry among the ladies, are the means by which
foreigners must make their way in this country.&nbsp; Avail
yourself of them, and leave the rest to us.&rdquo;&nbsp; This
lesson lasted some time.&nbsp; Bernes entered in the interim, and
they determined mutually to contribute towards my promotion.</p>
<p>Few of the young men who seek their fortune in foreign
countries meet incidents so favourable.&nbsp; Fortune for a
moment seemed willing to recompense my past sufferings, and again
to raise me to the height from which I had fallen.&nbsp; These
ambassadors, here again by accident met, had before been
witnesses of my prosperity when at Berlin.&nbsp; The talents I
possessed, and the favour I then enjoyed, attracted the notice of
all foreign ministers.&nbsp; They were bosom friends, equally
well read in the human heart, and equally benevolent and
noble-minded; their recommendation at court was decisive; the
nations they represented were in alliance with Russia, and the
confidence Bestuchef placed in them was unbounded.</p>
<p>I was now introduced into all companies, not as a foreigner
who came to entreat employment, but as the heir of the house of
Trenck, and its rich Hungarian possessions, and as the former
favourite of the Prussian monarch.</p>
<p>I was also admitted to the society of the first literati, and
wrote a poem on the anniversary of the coronation of the Empress
Elizabeth.&nbsp; Hyndford took care she should see it, and, in
conjunction with the chancellor, presented me to the
sovereign.&nbsp; My reception was most gracious.&nbsp; She
herself recommended me to the chancellor, and presented me with a
gold-hilted sword, worth a thousand roubles.&nbsp; This raised me
highly in the esteem of all the houses of the Bestuchef
party.</p>
<p>Manners were at that time so rude in Russia, that every
foreigner who gave a dinner, or a ball, must send notice to the
chancellor Bestuchef, that he might return a list of the guests
allowed to be invited.&nbsp; Faction governed everything; and
wherever Bestuchef was, no friend of Woranzow durst appear.&nbsp;
I was the intimate of the Austrian and English ambassadors;
consequently, was caressed and esteemed in all companies.&nbsp; I
soon became the favourite of the chancellor&rsquo;s lady, as I
shall hereafter notice; and nothing more was wanting to obtain
all I could wish.</p>
<p>I was well acquainted with architectural design, had free
access to the house and cabinet of the chancellor, where I drew
in company with Colonel Oettinger, who was then the head
architect of Russia, and made the perspective view of the new
palace, which the chancellor intended to build at Moscow, by
which I acquired universal honour.&nbsp; I had gained more
acquaintance in, and knowledge of, Russia in one month, than
others, wanting my means, have done in twelve.</p>
<p>As I was one day relating my progress to Lord Hyndford, he,
like a friend, grown grey in courts, kindly took the trouble to
advise me.&nbsp; From him I obtained a perfect knowledge of
Russia; he was acquainted with all the intrigues of European
courts, their families, party cabals, the foibles of the
monarchs, the principles of their government, the plots of the
great Peter, and had also made the peace of Breslau.&nbsp; Thus,
having been the confidential friend of Frederic, he was
intimately acquainted with his heart, as well as the sources of
his power.&nbsp; Hyndford was penetrating, noble-minded, had the
greatness of the Briton, without his haughtiness; and the
principles, by which he combined the past, the present, and the
future, were so clear, that I, his scholar, by adhering to them,
have been enabled to foretell all the most remarkable revolutions
that have happened, during the space of six-and-thirty years, in
Europe.&nbsp; By these I knew, when any minister was disgraced,
who should be his successor.&nbsp; I daily passed some hours
improving by his kind conversation; and to him I am indebted for
most of that knowledge of the world I happen to possess.</p>
<p>He took various opportunities of cautioning me against the
effects of an ardent, sanguine temper; and my hatred of arbitrary
power warned me to beware of the determined persecution of
Frederic, of his irreconcilable anger, his intrigues and
influence in the various courts of Europe, which he would
certainly exert to prevent my promotion, lest I should impede his
own projects, and lamented my future sufferings, which he plainly
foresaw.&nbsp; &ldquo;Despots,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;always are
suspicious, and abhor those who have a consciousness of their own
worth, of the rights of mankind, and hold the lash in
detestation.&nbsp; The enlightened are by them called the
restless spirits, turbulent and dangerous; and virtue there,
where virtue is unnecessary for the humbling and trampling upon
the suffering subject, is accounted a crime, of all others the
most to be dreaded.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hyndford taught me to know, and highly to value freedom: to
despise tyrants, to endure the worst of miseries, to emulate true
greatness of mind, to despise danger, and to honour only those
whose elevation of soul had taught them equally to oppose bigotry
and despotism.</p>
<p>Bernes was a philosopher; but with the penetration of an
Italian, more cautious than Hyndford, yet equally honest and
worthy.&nbsp; His friendship for me was unbounded, and the time
passed in their company was esteemed by me most precious.&nbsp;
The liberality of my sentiments, thirst after knowledge and
scientific acquirements gained their favour; our topics of
conversation were inexhaustible, and I acquired more real
information at Moscow than at Berlin, under the tuition of La
Metri, Maupertuis, and Voltaire.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>
<p>Scarcely had I been six weeks in this city before I had an
adventure which I shall here relate; for, myself excepted, all
the persons concerned in it are now dead.&nbsp; Intrigues
properly belong to novels.&nbsp; This book is intended for a more
serious purpose, and they are therefore here usually
suppressed.&nbsp; It cannot be supposed I was a
woman-hater.&nbsp; Most of the good or bad fortune I experienced
originated in love.&nbsp; I was not by nature inconstant, and was
incapable of deceit even in amours.&nbsp; In the very ardour of
youth I always shunned mere sensual pleasures.&nbsp; I loved for
more exalted reasons, and for such sought to be beloved
again.&nbsp; Love and friendship were with me always united; and
these I was capable of inciting, maintaining, and
deserving.&nbsp; The most difficult of access, the noblest, and
the fairest, were ever my choice: and my veneration for these
always deterred me from grosser gratifications.&nbsp; By woman I
was formed; by the faith of woman supported under misfortunes; in
the company of woman enjoyed the few hours of delight my life of
sorrows has experienced.&nbsp; Woman, beautiful and well
instructed, even now, lightens the burden of age, the
world&rsquo;s tediousness and its woes; and, when these are
ended, I would rather wish mine eyes might be closed by fair and
virgin hands, than, when expiring, fixed on a hypocritical
priest.</p>
<p>My adventures with women would amply furnish a romance: but
enough of this, I should not relate the present, were it not
necessary to my story.</p>
<p>Dining one public day with Lord Hyndford, I was seated beside
a charming young lady of one of the best families in Russia, who
had been promised in marriage, though only seventeen, to an old
invalid minister.&nbsp; Her eyes soon told me she thought me
preferable to her intended bridegroom.&nbsp; I understood them,
lamented her hard fate, and was surprised to hear her exclaim,
&ldquo;Oh, heavens! that it were possible you could deliver me
from my misfortune: I would engage to do whatever you would
direct.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The impression such an appeal must make on a man of four and
twenty, of a temperament like mine, may easily be supposed.&nbsp;
The lady was ravishingly beautiful; her soul was candour itself,
and her rank that of a princess; but the court commands had
already been given in favour of the marriage; and flight, with
all its inseparable dangers, was the only expedient.&nbsp; A
public table was no place for long explanations.&nbsp; Our hearts
were already one.&nbsp; I requested an interview, and the next
day was appointed, the place the Trotzer garden, where I passed
three rapturous hours in her company: thanks to her woman, who
was a Georgian.</p>
<p>To escape, however, from Moscow, was impossible.&nbsp; The
distance thence to any foreign country was too great.&nbsp; The
court was not to remove to Petersburg till the next spring, and
her marriage was fixed for the first of August.&nbsp; The
misfortune was not to be remedied, and nothing was left us but
patience perforce.&nbsp; We could only resolve to fly from
Petersburg when there, the soonest possible, and to take refuge
in some corner of the earth, where we might remain unknown of
all.&nbsp; The marriage, therefore, was celebrated with pomp,
though I, in despite of forms, was the true husband of the
princess.&nbsp; Such was the state of the husband imposed upon
her, that to describe it, and not give disgust, were
impossible.</p>
<p>The princess gave me her jewels, and several thousand roubles,
which she had received as a nuptial present, that I might
purchase every thing necessary for flight; my evil destiny,
however, had otherwise determined.&nbsp; I was playing at ombre
with her, one night, at the house of the Countess of Bestuchef,
when she complained of a violent headache, appointed me to meet
her on the morrow, in the Trotzer gardens, clasped my hand with
inexpressible emotion, and departed.&nbsp; Alas!&nbsp; I never
beheld her more, till stretched upon the bier!</p>
<p>She grew delirious that very night, and so continued till her
death, which happened on the sixth day, when the small-pox began
to appear.&nbsp; During her delirium she discovered our love, and
incessantly called on me to deliver her from her tyrant.&nbsp;
Thus, in the flower of her age, perished one of the most lovely
women I ever knew, and with her fled all I held most dear.</p>
<p>All my plans were now to be newly arranged.&nbsp; Lord
Hyndford alone was in the secret, for I hid no secrets from him:
he strengthened me in my first resolution, and owned that he
himself, for such a mistress, might perhaps have been weak enough
to have acted as I had done.&nbsp; Almost as much moved as
myself, he sympathised with me as a friend, and his advice
deterred me from ending my miseries, and descending with her,
whom I have loved and lost, to the grave.&nbsp; This was the
severest trial I had ever felt.&nbsp; Our affection was
unbounded, and such only as noble hearts can feel.&nbsp; She
being gone, the whole world became a desert.&nbsp; There is not a
man on earth, whose life affords more various turns of fate than
mine.&nbsp; Swiftly raised to the highest pinnacle of hope, as
suddenly was I cast headlong down, and so remarkable were these
revolutions that he who has read my history will at last find it
difficult to say whether he envies or pities me most.&nbsp; And
yet these were, in reality, but preparatory to the evils that
hovered over my devoted head.&nbsp; Had not the remembrance of
past joys soothed and supported me under my sufferings, I
certainly should not have endured the ten years&rsquo; torture of
the Magdeburg dungeon, with a fortitude that might have been
worthy even of Socrates.</p>
<p>Enough of this.&nbsp; My blood again courses swifter through
my veins as I write!&nbsp; Rest, gentle maiden, noble and lovely
as thou wert!&nbsp; For thee ought Heaven to have united a form
so fair, animated as it was, by a soul so pure, to ever-blooming
youth and immortality.</p>
<p>My love for this lady became well-known in Moscow; yet her
corpulent overgrown husband had not understanding enough to
suppose there was any meaning in her rhapsodies during her
delirium.</p>
<p>Her gifts to me amounted in value to about seven thousand
ducats.&nbsp; Lord Hyndford and Count Bernes both adjudged them
legally mine, and well am I assured her heart had bequeathed me
much more.</p>
<p>To this event succeeded another, by which my fortune was
greatly influenced.&nbsp; The Countess of Bestuchef was then the
most amiable and witty woman at Court.&nbsp; Her husband,
cunning, selfish, and shallow, had the name of minister, while
she, in reality, governed with a genius, at once daring and
comprehensive.&nbsp; The too pliant Elizabeth carelessly left the
most important things to the direction of others.&nbsp; Thus the
Countess was the first person of the Empire, and on whom the
attention of the foreign ministers was fixed.</p>
<p>Haughty and majestic in her demeanour, she was supposed to be
the only woman at court who continued faithful to her husband;
which supposition probably originated in her art and education,
she being a German born: for I afterwards found her virtue was
only pride, and a knowledge of the national character.&nbsp; The
Russian lover rules despotic over his mistress: requires money,
submission, and should he meet opposition, threatens her with
blows, and the discovery of her secret.</p>
<p>During Elizabeth&rsquo;s reign foreigners could neither appear
at court, nor in the best company, without the introduction of
Bestuchef.&nbsp; I and Sievers, gentlemen of the chamber, were at
that time the only Germans who had free egress and regress in all
houses of fashion; my being protected by the English and Austrian
ambassadors gave me very peculiar advantages, and made my company
everywhere courted.</p>
<p>Bestuchef had been resident, during the late reign, at
Hamburg, in which inferior station he married the countess, at
that time, though young and handsome, only the widow of the
merchant Boettger.&nbsp; Under Elizabeth, Bestuchef rose to the
summit of rank and power, and the widow Boettger became the first
lady of the empire.&nbsp; When I knew her she was eight and
thirty, consequently no beauty, though a woman highly endowed in
mind and manners, of keen discernment, disliking the Russians,
protecting the Prussians, and at whose aversions all
trembled.</p>
<p>Her carriage towards the Russians was, what it must be in her
situation, lofty, cautious, and ironical, rather than kind.&nbsp;
To me she showed the utmost esteem on all occasions, welcomed me
at her table, and often admitted me to drink coffee in company
with herself alone and Colonel Oettinger.&nbsp; The countess
never failed giving me to understand she had perceived my love
for the princess N---; and, though I constantly denied the fact,
she related circumstances which she could have known, as I
thought, only from my mistress herself; my silence pleased her;
for the Russians, when a lady had a partiality for them, never
fail to vaunt of their good fortune.&nbsp; She wished to persuade
me she had observed us in company, had read the language of our
eyes, and had long penetrated our secret.&nbsp; I was ignorant at
that time that she had then, and long before, entertained the
maid of my mistress as a spy in her pay.</p>
<p>About a week after the death of the princess, the countess
invited me to take coffee with her, in her chamber; lamented my
loss, and the violence of that passion which had deprived me of
all my customary vivacity, and altered my very appearance.&nbsp;
She seemed so interested in my behalf, and expressed so many
wishes, and so ardent to better my fate, that I could no longer
doubt.&nbsp; Another opportunity soon happened, which confirmed
these my suspicions: her mouth confessed her sentiments.&nbsp;
Discretion, secrecy, and fidelity, were the laws she imposed, and
never did I experience a more ardent passion from woman.&nbsp;
Such was her understanding and penetration, she knew how to rivet
my affections.</p>
<p>Caution was the thing most necessary.&nbsp; She contrived,
however, to make opportunity.&nbsp; The chancellor valued,
confided in me, and employed me in his cabinet; so that I
remained whole days in his house.&nbsp; My captainship of cavalry
was now no longer thought of: I was destined to political
employment.&nbsp; My first was to be gentleman of the chamber,
which in Russia is an office of importance, and the prospect of
futurity became to me most resplendent.&nbsp; Lord Hyndford, ever
the repository of my secrets, counselled me, formed plans for my
conduct, rejoiced at my success, and refused to be reimbursed the
expense he had been at, though now my circumstances were
prosperous.</p>
<p>The degree of credit I enjoyed was soon noticed: foreign
ministers began to pay their court to me: Goltz, the Prussian
minister, made every effort to win me, but found me
incorruptible.</p>
<p>The Russian alliance was at this time highly courted by
foreign powers; the humbling of Prussia was the thing generally
wished and planned: and nobody was better informed than myself of
ministerial and family factions at this court.</p>
<p>My mistress, a year after my acquaintance with her, fell into
her enemies&rsquo; power, and with her husband, was delivered
over to the executioner.&nbsp; Chancellor Bestuchef, in the year
1756, was forced to confession by the knout.&nbsp; Apraxin,
minister of war, had a similar fate.&nbsp; The wife of his
brother, then envoy in Poland, was, by the treachery of a certain
Lieutenant Berger, with three others of the first ladies of the
court, knouted, branded, and had their tongues cut out.&nbsp;
This happened in the year 1741, when Elizabeth ascended the
throne.&nbsp; Her husband, however, faithfully served: I knew him
as Russian envoy, at Vienna, 1751.&nbsp; This may indeed be
called the love of our country, and thus does it happen to the
first men of the state: what then can a foreigner hope for, if
persecuted, and in the power of those in authority?</p>
<p>No man, in so short a space of time, had greater opportunities
than I, to discover the secrets of state; especially when guided
by Hyndford and Bernes, under the reign of a well-meaning but
short-sighted Empress, whose first minister was a weak man,
directed by the will of an able and ambitious wife, and which
wife loved me, a stranger, an acquaintance of only a few months,
so passionately that to this passion she would have sacrificed
every other object.&nbsp; She might, in fact, be considered as
Empress of Russia, disposing of peace or war, and had I been more
prudent or less sincere, I might in such a situation, have
amassed treasures, and deposited them in full security.&nbsp; Her
generosity was boundless; and, though obliged to pay above a
hundred thousand roubles, in one year, to discharge her
son&rsquo;s debts, yet might I have saved a still larger sum; but
half of the gifts she obliged me to receive, I lent to this son,
and lost.&nbsp; So far was I from selfish, and so negligent of
wealth, that by supplying the wants of others, I often, on a
reverse of fortune, suffered want myself.</p>
<p>This my splendid success in Russia displeased the great
Frederic, whose persecution everywhere attended me, and who
supposed his interest injured by my success in Russia.&nbsp; The
incident I am going to relate was, at the time it happened, well
known to, and caused much agitation among all the foreign
ambassadors.</p>
<p>Lord Hyndford desired I would make him a fair copy of a plan
of Cronstadt, for which he furnished the materials, with three
additional drawings of the various ships in the harbour, and
their names.&nbsp; There was neither danger nor suspicion
attending this; the plan of Cronstadt being no secret, but
publicly sold in the shops of Petersburg.&nbsp; England was
likewise then in the closest alliance with Russia.&nbsp; Hyndford
showed the drawing to Funk, the Saxon envoy, his intimate friend,
who asked his permission to copy it himself.&nbsp; Hyndford gave
him the plan signed with my name; and after Funk had been some
days employed copying it, the Prussian minister, Goltz, who lived
in his neighbourhood, came in, as he frequently paid him friendly
visits.&nbsp; Funk, unsuspectingly, showed him my drawing, and
both lamented that Frederic had lost so useful a subject.&nbsp;
Goltz asked to borrow it for a couple of days, in order to
correct his own; and Funk, one of the worthiest, most honest, and
least suspicious of men, who loved me like a brother, accordingly
lent the plan.</p>
<p>No sooner was Goltz in possession of it than he hurried to the
chancellor, with whose weakness he was well acquainted, told him
his intent in coming was to prove that a man, who had once been
unfaithful to his king and country, where he had been loaded with
favours, would certainly betray, for his own private interest,
every state where he was trusted.&nbsp; He continued his preface,
by speaking of the rapid progress I had made in Russia, and the
free entrance I had found in the chancellor&rsquo;s house, where
I was received as a son, and initiated in the secrets of the
cabinet.</p>
<p>The chancellor defended me: Goltz then endeavoured to incite
his jealousy, and told him my private interviews with his wife,
especially in the palace-garden, were publicly spoken of.&nbsp;
This he had learned from his spies, he having endeavoured, by the
snares he laid, to make my destruction certain.</p>
<p>He likewise led Bestuchef to suspect his secretary, S-n, was a
party in the intrigue; till at last the chancellor became very
angry; Goltz then took my plan of Cronstadt from his pocket, and
added, &ldquo;Your excellency is nourishing a serpent in your
bosom.&nbsp; This drawing have I received from Trenck, copied
from your cabinet designs, for two hundred ducats.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He knew I was employed there sometimes with Oettinger, whose
office it was to inspect the buildings and repairs of the Russian
fortifications.&nbsp; Bestuchef was astonished; his anger became
violent, and Goltz added fuel to the flame, by insinuating, I
should not be so powerfully protected by Bernes, the Austrian
ambassador, were it not to favour the views of his own
court.&nbsp; Bestuchef mentioned prosecution and the knout; Goltz
replied my friends were too powerful, my pardon would be
procured, and the evil this way increased.&nbsp; They therefore
determined to have me secretly secured, and privately conveyed to
Siberia.</p>
<p>Thus, while I unsuspectingly dreamed of nothing but happiness,
the gathering storm threatened destruction, which only was
averted by accident, or God&rsquo;s good providence.</p>
<p>Goltz had scarcely left the place triumphant, when the
chancellor entered, with bitterness and rancour in his heart,
into his lady&rsquo;s apartment, reproached her with my conduct,
and while she endeavoured to soothe him, related all that had
passed.&nbsp; Her penetration was much deeper than her
husband&rsquo;s: she perceived there was a plot against me: she
indeed knew my heart better than any other, and particularly that
I was not in want of a poor two hundred ducats.&nbsp; She could
not, however, appease him, and my arrest was determined.&nbsp;
She therefore instantly wrote me a line to the following
purport.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are threatened, dear friend, by a very imminent
danger.&nbsp; Do not sleep to-night at home, but secure yourself
at Lord Hyndford&rsquo;s till you hear farther from
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Secretary S-n, her confidant (the same who, not long since,
was Russian envoy at Ratisbon) was sent with the note.&nbsp; He
found me, after dinner, at the English ambassador&rsquo;s, and
called me aside.&nbsp; I read the billet, was astonished at its
contents, and showed it Lord Hyndford.&nbsp; My conscience was
void of reproach, except that we suspected my secret with the
countess had been betrayed to the chancellor, and fearing his
jealousy, Hyndford commanded me to remain in his house till we
should make further discovery.</p>
<p>We placed spies round the house where I lived; I was inquired
for after midnight, and the lieutenant of the police came himself
and searched the house.</p>
<p>Lord Hyndford went, about ten in the morning, to visit the
chancellor, that he might obtain some intelligence, who
immediately reproached him for having granted an asylum to a
traitor.&nbsp; &ldquo;What has this traitor done?&rdquo; said
Hyndford.&nbsp; &ldquo;Faithlessly copied a plan of Cronstadt,
from my cabinet drawings,&rdquo; said the chancellor;
&ldquo;which he has sold to the Prussian minister for two hundred
ducats.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hyndford was astonished; he knew me well, and also knew that
he had then in money and jewels, more than eight thousand ducats
of mine in his own hands: nor was he less ignorant of the value I
set on money, or of the sources whence I could obtain it, when I
pleased.&nbsp; &ldquo;Has your excellency actually seen this
drawing of Trenck&rsquo;s?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Yes, I have been
shown it by Goltz.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I wish I might likewise be
permitted to see it; I know Trenck&rsquo;s drawing, and make
myself responsible that he is no traitor.&nbsp; Here is some
mystery; be so kind as to desire M. Goltz will come and bring his
plan of Cronstadt.&nbsp; Trenck is at my house, shall be
forthcoming instantly, and I will not protect him if he proves
guilty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Chancellor wrote to Goltz; but he, artful as he was, had
no doubt taken care to be informed that the lieutenant of the
police had missed his prey.&nbsp; He therefore sent an excuse,
and did not appear.&nbsp; In the meantime I entered; Hyndford
then addressed me, with the openness of an Englishman, and asked,
&ldquo;Are you a traitor, Trenck?&nbsp; If so, you do not merit
my protection, but stand here as a state prisoner.&nbsp; Have you
sold a plan of Cronstadt to M. Goltz?&rdquo;&nbsp; My answer may
easily be supposed.&nbsp; Hyndford rehearsed what the chancellor
had told him; I was desired to leave the room, and Funk was sent
for.&nbsp; The moment he came in, Hyndford said, &ldquo;Sir,
where is that plan of Cronstadt which Trenck copied?&rdquo;&nbsp;
Funk, hesitating, replied, &ldquo;I will go for it.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Have you it,&rdquo; continued Hyndford, &ldquo;at
home?&nbsp; Speak, upon your honour.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;No, my
Lord, I have lent it, for a few days, to M. Goltz, that he may
take a copy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hyndford immediately then saw the whole affair, told the
chancellor the history of this plan, which belonged to him, and
which he had lent to Funk, and requested a trusty person might be
sent with him to make a proper search.&nbsp; Bestuchef named his
first secretary, and to him were added Funk and the Dutch envoy,
Schwart, who happened then to enter.&nbsp; All went together to
the house of Goltz.&nbsp; Funk demanded his plan of Cronstadt;
Goltz gave it him, and Funk returned it to Lord Hyndford.</p>
<p>The secretary and Hyndford both then desired he would produce
the plan of Cronstadt which he had bought of Trenck for two
hundred ducats.&nbsp; His confusion now was great, and Hyndford
firmly insisted this plan should be forthcoming, to vindicate the
honour of Trenck, whom he held to be an honest man.&nbsp; On
this, Goltz answered, &ldquo;I have received my king&rsquo;s
commands to prevent the preferment of Trenck in Russia, and I
have only fulfilled the duty of a minister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hyndford spat on the ground, and said more than I choose to
repeat; after which the four gentlemen returned to the
chancellor, and I was again called.&nbsp; Everybody complimented
me, related to me what had passed, and the chancellor promised I
should be recompensed; strictly, however, forbidding me to take
any revenge on the Prussian ambassador, I having sworn, in the
first transports of anger, to punish him wherever I should find
him, even were it at the altar&rsquo;s foot.</p>
<p>The chancellor soothed me, kept me to dine with him, and
endeavoured to assuage my boiling passions.&nbsp; The countess
affected indifference, and asked me if suchlike actions
characterised the Prussian nation.&nbsp; Funk and Schwart were at
table.&nbsp; All present congratulated me on my victory, but none
knew to whom I was indebted for my deliverance from the hasty and
unjust condemnation of the chancellor, although my protectress
was one of the company.&nbsp; I received a present of two
thousand roubles the next day from the chancellor, with orders to
thank the Empress for this mark of her bounty, and accept it as a
sign of her special favour.&nbsp; I paid these my thanks some
days after.&nbsp; The money I disregarded, but the amiable
Empress, by her enchanting benevolence, made me forget the
past.&nbsp; The story became public, and Goltz appeared neither
in public, nor at court.&nbsp; The manner in which the countess
personally reproached him, I shall out of respect pass
over.&nbsp; Bernes, the crafty Piedmontese, assured me of
revenge, without my troubling myself in the matter,
and&mdash;what happened after I know not; Goltz appeared but
little in company, fell ill when I had left Russia, and died soon
after of a consumption.</p>
<p>This vile man was, no doubt, the cause of all the calamities
which fell upon me.&nbsp; I should have become one of the first
men in Russia: the misfortune that befel Bestuchef and his family
some years afterward might have been averted: I should never have
returned to Vienna, a city so fatal to the name of Trenck: by the
mediation of the Russian Court, I should have recovered my great
Sclavonian estates; my days of persecution at Vienna would have
passed in peace and pleasure: nor should I have entered the
dungeon of Magdeburg.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>
<p>How little did the Great Frederic know my heart.&nbsp; Without
having offended, he had rendered me miserable, had condemned me
to imprisonment at Glatz on mere suspicion, and on my flying
thence, naked and destitute, had confiscated my paternal
inheritance.&nbsp; Not contented with inflicting all these
calamities, he would not suffer me peaceably to seek my fortune
in a foreign land.</p>
<p>Few are the youths who, in so short a time, being expelled
their native country with disgrace, by their own efforts, merits,
and talents, have obtained honour and favour so great, acquired
such powerful friends, or been entrusted with confidence equally
unlimited in transactions so important.&nbsp; Enraged as I was at
the treachery of Goltz, had opportunity offered, I might have
been tempted even to turn my native country into a desert; nor do
I deny that I afterwards promoted the views of the Austrian
envoy, who knew well how to cherish the flame that had been
kindled, and turn it to his own use.&nbsp; Till this moment I
never felt the least enmity either to my country or king, nor did
I suffer myself, on any occasion, to be made the agent of their
disadvantage.</p>
<p>No sooner was I entrusted more intimately with cabinet
secrets, than I discovered the state of factions, and that
Bestuchef and Apraxin were even then in Prussian pay; that a
counterpoise, by their means, might be formed to the prevalence
of the Austrian party.</p>
<p>Hence we may date the change of Russian politics in the year
1762.&nbsp; Here also we may find a clue to the contradictory
orders, artifices, positions, retreats and disappointments of the
Russian army, in the seven years&rsquo; war, beginning in
1756.&nbsp; The countess, who was obliged to act with greater
caution, foresaw the consequence of the various intrigues in
which her husband was engaged: her love for me naturally drew her
from her former party; she confided every secret to me, and ever
remained till her fall, which happened in 1758, during my
imprisonment, my best friend and correspondent.&nbsp; Hence was I
so well informed of all the plans against Prussia, to the years
1754 and 1756; much more so than many ministers of the interested
courts, who imagined they alone were in the secret.&nbsp; How
many after events could I then have foretold!&nbsp; Such was the
perverseness of my destiny, that where I should most have been
sought for, and best known, there was I least valued.</p>
<p>No man, in my youth, would have believed I should live to my
sixtieth year, untitled and obscure.&nbsp; In Berlin, Petersburg,
London, and Paris, have I been esteemed by the greatest
statesmen, and now am I reduced to the invalid list.&nbsp; How
strange are the caprices of fortune!&nbsp; I ought never to have
left Russia: this was my great error, which I still live to
repent.</p>
<p>I have never been accustomed to sleep more than four or five
hours, so that through life I have allowed time for paying visits
and receiving company.&nbsp; I have still had sufficient for
study and improvement.&nbsp; Hyndford was my instructor in
politics; Boerhaave, then physician to the court, my bosom
friend, my tutor in physic and literary subjects.&nbsp; Women
formed me for court intrigues, though these, as a philosopher, I
despised.</p>
<p>The chancellor had greatly changed his carriage towards me
since the incident of the plan.&nbsp; He observed my looks,
showed he was distrustful, and desirous of revenge.&nbsp; His
lady, as well as myself, remarked this, and new measures became
necessary.&nbsp; I was obliged to act an artful, but, at the same
time, a very dangerous part.</p>
<p>My cousin, Baron Trenck, died in the Spielberg, October 4,
1749, and left me his heir, on condition I should only serve the
house of Austria.&nbsp; In March, 1750, Count Bernes received the
citation sent me to enter on this inheritance.&nbsp; I would hear
nothing of Vienna; the abominable treatment of my cousin
terrified me.&nbsp; I well knew the origin of his prosecution,
the services he had rendered his country, and had been an
eye-witness of the injustice by which he was repaid.&nbsp; Bernes
represented to me that the property left me was worth much above
a million: that the empress would support me in pursuit of
justice, and that I had no personal enemy at Vienna, that a
million of certain property in Hungary was much superior to the
highest expectations in Russia, where I myself had beheld so many
changes of fortune, and the effects of family cabals.&nbsp;
Russia he painted as dangerous, Vienna as secure, and promised me
himself effectual assistance, as his embassy would end within the
year.&nbsp; Were I once rich, I might reside in what country I
pleased; nor could the persecutions of Frederic anywhere pursue
me so ineffectually as in Austria.&nbsp; Snares would be laid for
me everywhere else, as I had experienced in Russia.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;would have been the
consequence, had not the countess warned you of the impending
danger?&nbsp; You, like many other honest and innocent men, would
have been sent to Siberia.&nbsp; Your innocence must have
remained untested, and yourself, in the universal opinion, a
villain and a traitor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hyndford spoke to me in the same tone, assured me of his
eternal protection, and described London as a certain asylum,
should I not find happiness at Vienna.&nbsp; He spoke of slavery
as a Briton ought to speak, reminded me of the fate of Munich and
Osterman, painted the court such as I knew it to be, and asked me
what were my expectations, even were I fortunate enough to become
general or minister in such a country.</p>
<p>These reasonings at length determined me; but having plenty of
money, I thought proper to take Stockholm, Copenhagen, and
Holland in my way, and Barnes was in the meantime to prepare me a
favourable reception at Vienna.&nbsp; He desired, also, I would
give him authority to get possession of the estates to which I
was heir.&nbsp; My mistress strongly endeavoured to detain me,
but yielded at length to the force of reason.&nbsp; I tore myself
away, and promised, on my honour, to return as soon as I had
arranged my affairs at Vienna.&nbsp; She made the proposition of
investing me within some foreign embassy, by which I might render
the most effectual services to the court at Vienna.&nbsp; In this
hope we parted with heavy hearts: she presented me with her
portrait, and a snuffbox set with diamonds; the first of these,
three years after was torn from my bosom by the officers in my
first dungeon at Magdeburg, as I shall hereafter relate.&nbsp;
The chancellor embraced me, at parting, with friendship.&nbsp;
Apraxin wept, and clasped me in his arms, prophesying at the same
time, I should never be so happy as in Russia.&nbsp; I myself
foreboded misfortune, and quitted Russia with regret, but still
followed the advice of Hyndford and Bernes.</p>
<p>From Moscow I travelled to Petersburg, where I found a letter,
at the house of Baron Wolf, the banker, from the countess, which
rent my very heart, and almost determined me to return.&nbsp; She
endeavoured to terrify me from proceeding to Vienna, yet inclosed
a bill for four thousand roubles, to aid me on my journey, were I
absolutely bent to turn my back on fortune.</p>
<p>My effects, in money and jewels, amounted to about thirty-six
thousand florins; I therefore returned the draft, intreated her
eternal remembrance, and that she would reserve her favour and
support to times in which they might become needful.&nbsp; After
remaining a few days at Petersburg, I journeyed, by land, to
Stockholm; taking with me letters of recommendation from all the
foreign envoys.</p>
<p>I forgot to mention that Funk was inconsolable for my
departure; his imprudence had nearly plunged me into misery, and
destroyed all my hopes in Russia.&nbsp; Twenty-two years after
this I met the worthy man, once more in Dresden.&nbsp; He, there,
considered himself as the cause of all the evils inflicted on me,
and assured me the recital of my sufferings had been so many
bitter reproaches to his soul.&nbsp; Our recapitulation of former
times gave us endless pleasure, and it was the sweetest of joys
to meet and renew my friendship with such a man, after having
weathered so many storms of fate.</p>
<p>At Stockholm I wanted for no recommendation; the Queen, sister
to the great Frederic, had known me at Berlin, when I had the
honour, as an officer of the body guard, of accompanying her to
Stettin.&nbsp; I related my whole history to her without
reserve.&nbsp; She, from political motives, advised me not to
make any stay at Stockholm, and to me continued till death, an
ever-gracious lady.&nbsp; I proceeded to Copenhagen, where I had
business to transact for M. Chaise, the Danish envoy at Moscow:
from whom also I had letters of recommendation.&nbsp; Here I had
the pleasure of meeting my old friend, Lieutenant Bach, who had
aided me in my escape from my imprisonment at Glatz.&nbsp; He was
poor and in debt, and I procured him protection, by relating the
noble manner in which he behaved I also presented him with five
hundred ducats, by the aid of which he pushed his fortune.&nbsp;
He wrote to me in the year 1776, a letter of sincere thanks, and
died a colonel of hussars in the Danish service in 1776.</p>
<p>I remained in Copenhagen but a fortnight, and then sailed in a
Dutch ship, from Elsineur to Amsterdam.&nbsp; Scarcely had we put
to sea, before a storm arose, by which we lost a mast and
bowsprit, had our sails shattered, and were obliged to cast
anchor among the rocks of Gottenburg, where our deliverance was
singularly fortunate.</p>
<p>Here we lay nine days before we could make the open sea, and
here I found a very pleasant amusement, by going daily in the
ship&rsquo;s boat from rock to rock, attended by two of my
servants, to shoot wild ducks, and catch shell-fish; whence I
every evening returned with provisions, and sheep&rsquo;s milk,
bought of the poor inhabitants, for the ship&rsquo;s crew.</p>
<p>There was a dearth among these poor people.&nbsp; Our vessel
was laden with corn; some of this I purchased, to the amount of
some hundreds of Dutch florins, and distributed wherever I
went.&nbsp; I also gave one of their ministers a hundred florins
for his poor congregation, who was himself in want of bread, and
whose annual stipend amounted to one hundred and fifty
florins.</p>
<p>Here in the sweet pleasure of doing good, I left behind me
much of that money I had so easily acquired in Russia; and
perhaps had we stayed much longer should myself have left the
place in poverty.&nbsp; A thousand blessings followed me, and the
storm-driven Trenck was long remembered and talked of at
Gottenburg.</p>
<p>In this worthy employment, however, I had nearly lost my
life.&nbsp; Returning from carrying corn, the wind rose, and
drove the boat to sea.&nbsp; I not understanding the management
of the helm, and the servants awkwardly handling the sails, the
boat in tacking was overset.&nbsp; The benefit of learning to
swim, I again experienced, and my faithful servant, who had
gained the rock, aided me when almost spent.&nbsp; The good
people who had seen the shallop overset, came off in their boats
to my assistance.&nbsp; An honest Calmuc, whom I had brought from
Russia, and another of my servants perished.&nbsp; I saw the
first sink after I had reached the shore.</p>
<p>The kind Swedes brought me on board, and also righted and
returned with the shallop.&nbsp; For some days I was
sea-sick.&nbsp; We weighed anchor, and sailed for the Texel, the
mouth of which we saw, and the pilots coming off, when another
storm arose, and drove us to the port of Bahus, in Norway, into
which we ran, without farther damage.&nbsp; In some few days we
again set sail, with a fair wind, and at length reached
Amsterdam.</p>
<p>Here I made no long stay; for the day after my arrival, an
extraordinary adventure happened, in which I was engaged chiefly
by my own rashness.</p>
<p>I was a spectator while the harpooners belonging to the whale
fishery were exercising themselves in darting their harpoons,
most of whom were drunk.&nbsp; One of them, Herman Rogaar by
name, a hero among these people, for his dexterity with his
snickasnee, came up, and passed some of his coarse jests upon my
Turkish sabre, and offered to fillip me on the nose.&nbsp; I
pushed him from me, and the fellow threw down his cap, drew his
snickasnee, challenged me, called me monkey-tail, and asked
whether I chose a straight, a circular, or a cross cut.</p>
<p>Thus here was I, in this excellent company, with no choice but
that of either fighting or running away.&nbsp; The robust,
Herculean fellow grew more insolent, and I, turning round to the
bystanders, asked them to lend me a snickasnee.&nbsp; &ldquo;No,
no,&rdquo; said the challenger, &ldquo;draw your great knife from
your side, and, long as it is, I will lay you a dozen ducats you
get a gash in the cheek.&rdquo;&nbsp; I drew; he confidently
advanced with his snickasnee, and, at the first stroke of my
sabre, that, and the hand that held it, both dropped to the
ground, and the blood spouted in my face.</p>
<p>I now expected the people would, indubitably, tear me to
pieces; but my fear was changed into astonishment at hearing a
universal shout applauding the vanquisher of the redoubted Herman
Rogaar who, so lately feared for his strength and dexterity,
became the object of their ridicule.&nbsp; A Jew spectator
conducted me out of the crowd, and the people clamorously
followed me to my inn.&nbsp; This kind of duel, by which I gained
honour, would anywhere else have brought me to the highest
disgrace.&nbsp; A man who knew the use of the sabre, in a single
day, might certainly have disabled a hundred Herman
Rogaars.&nbsp; This story may instruct and warn others.&nbsp; He
that is quarrelsome shall never want an enemy.&nbsp; My temerity
often engaged me in disputes which, by timely compliance and
calmness, might easily have been avoided; but my evil genius
always impelled me into the paths of perplexity, and I seldom saw
danger till it was inevitable</p>
<p>I left Amsterdam for the Hague, where I had been recommended
to Lord Holderness, the English ambassador, by Lord Hyndford; to
Baron Reisbach, by Bernes; to the Grand Pensionary Fagel, by
Schwart; and from the chancellor I had a letter to the Prince of
Orange himself I could not, therefore, but be everywhere received
with all possible distinction.&nbsp; Within these
recommendations, and the knowledge I possessed, had I had the
good fortune to have avoided Vienna, and gone to India, where my
talents would have insured me wealth, how many tears of
affliction had I been spared!&nbsp; My ill fortune, however, had
brought me letters from Count Bernes, assuring me that heaven was
at Vienna, and including a citation from the high court,
requiring me to give in my claim of inheritance.&nbsp; Bernes
further informed me the Austrian court had assured him I should
meet with all justice and protection, and advised me to hasten my
journey, as the executorship of the estates of Trenck was
conducted but little to my advantage.</p>
<p>This advice I took, proceeded to Vienna, and from that moment
all my happiness had an end.&nbsp; I became bewildered in
lawsuits, and the arts of wicked men, and all possible calamities
assaulted me at once, the recital of which would itself afford
subject matter for a history.&nbsp; They began by the following
incidents:&mdash;</p>
<p>One M. Schenck sought my acquaintance at the Hague.&nbsp; I
met with him at my hotel, where he intreated I would take him to
Nuremberg, whence he was to proceed to Saxony.&nbsp; I complied,
and bore his expenses; but at Hanau, waking in the morning, I
found my watch, set with diamonds, a ring worth two thousand
roubles, a diamond snuff-box, with my mistress&rsquo;s picture,
and my purse, containing about eighty ducats, stolen from my
bed-side, and Schenck become invisible.&nbsp; Little affected by
the loss of money, at any time, I yet was grieved for my
snuff-box.&nbsp; The rascal, however, had escaped, and it was
fortunate that the remainder of my ready money, with my bills of
exchange, were safely locked up.</p>
<p>I now pursued my journey without company, and arrived in
Vienna.&nbsp; I cannot exactly recollect in what month, but I had
been absent about two years; and the reader will allow that it
was barely possible for any man, in so short a time, to have
experienced more various changes of fate, though many smaller
incidents have been suppressed.&nbsp; The places, where my
pledged fidelity required discretion will be easily supposed, as
likewise will the concealment of court intrigues, and artifices,
the publication of which might even yet subject me to more
persecutions.&nbsp; All writers are not permitted to speak truth
of monarchs and ministers.&nbsp; I am the father of eight
children, and parental love and duty vanquish the inclination of
the author; and this duty, this affection, have made me
particularly cautious in relating what happened to me at Vienna,
that I might, thereby, serve them more effectually than by
indulging the pride of the writer, or the vengeance of the
man.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>
<p>Since accounts so various, contradictory, and dishonourable to
the name of Trenck, have been circulated in Vienna, concerning
facts which happened thirty-seven years ago, I will here give a
short abstract of them, and such as may he verified by the
records of the court.&nbsp; I pledge my honour to the truth of
the statement, and were I so allowed, would prove it, to the
conviction of any unprejudiced court of justice: but this I
cannot hope, as princes are much more disposed to bestow
unmerited favours than to make retribution to those whom they
have unjustly punished.</p>
<p>Francis Baron Trenck died in the Spielberg, October 4th,
1749.&nbsp; It has been erroneously believed in Vienna that his
estates were confiscated by the sentence which condemned him to
the Spielberg.&nbsp; He had committed no offence against the
state, was accused of none, much less convicted.&nbsp; The court
sentence was that the administration of his estate should be
committed to Counsellor Kempf and Baron Peyaczewitz, who were
selected by himself, and the accounts of his stewards and farmers
were to be sent him yearly.&nbsp; He continued, till his death,
to have the free and entire disposal of his property.</p>
<p>Although, before his death, he sent for his advocate, Doctor
Berger, and by him petitioned the Empress she would issue the
necessary orders to the Governor of the Spielberg, to permit the
entrance of witnesses, and all things necessary to make a legal
will, it by no means follows that he petitioned her for
permission to make this will.&nbsp; The case is too clear to
admit of doubt.&nbsp; The royal commands were given, that he
should enjoy all freedom of making his will.&nbsp; Permission was
also given that, during his sickness, he might be removed to the
capuchin convent, which was equal to liberty, but this he refused
to accept.</p>
<p>Neither was his ability to make a will questioned.&nbsp; The
advocate was only to request the Queen&rsquo;s permission to
supply some formalities, which had been neglected, when he
purchased the lordships of Velika and Nustar, which petition was
likewise granted.&nbsp; The royal mandate still exists, which
commissioned the persons therein named as trustees to the estate
and effects of Trenck, and this mandate runs thus: &ldquo;Let the
last will of Trenck be duly executed: let dispatch be used, and
the heir protected in all his rights.&rdquo;&nbsp; Confiscation,
therefore, had never been thought of, nor his power to make a
will questioned.</p>
<p>I will now show how I have been deprived of this valuable
inheritance, while I have been obliged to pay above sixty
thousand florins, to defray legacies he had left; and when this
narrative is read, it will no longer be affirmed at Vienna, that
by the favours of the court I inherited seventy-six thousand
florins, or the lordship of Zwerbach from Trenck, I shall proceed
to my proofs.</p>
<p>The father of Baron Trenck, who died in the year 1743,
governor of Leitschau, in Hungary, named me in his will the
successor of his son, should he die without heirs male.</p>
<p>This will was sent to be proved, according to form, at Vienna,
after having been authenticated in the most legal manner in
Hungary.&nbsp; The court called Hofkriegsrath, at Vienna,
neglected to provide a curator for the security of the next heir;
yet this could not annul my right of succession.&nbsp; When
Trenck succeeded his father, he entered no protest to this, his
father&rsquo;s will; therefore, dying without children, in the
year 1749, my claim was indisputable.&nbsp; I was heir had he
made no will: and even in case of confiscation, my title to his
father&rsquo;s estates still remained valid.</p>
<p>Trenck knew this but too well: he, as I have before related,
was my worst enemy, and even attempted my life.&nbsp; I will
therefore proceed to show the real intent of this his crafty
testament.</p>
<p>Determined no longer to live in confinement, or to ask
forgiveness, by which, it is well known, he might have obtained
his freedom, having lost all hopes of reimbursing his losses, his
avarice was reduced to despair.&nbsp; His desire of fame was
unbounded, and this could no way be gratified but by having
himself canonized for a saint, after spending his life in
committing all the ravages of a pandour.&nbsp; Hence originated
the following facts:&mdash;</p>
<p>He knew I was the legal claimant to his father&rsquo;s
estates.&nbsp; His father had bought with the family money,
remitted from Prussia, the lordships of Prestowacz and
Pleternitz, in Sclavonia, and he himself, during his
father&rsquo;s life, and with his father&rsquo;s money, had
purchased the lordship of Pakratz, for forty thousand florins:
this must therefore descend also to me, he having no more power
to will this from me, than he had the remainder of his paternal
inheritance.&nbsp; The property he himself had gained was
consigned to administrators, but a hundred thousand florins had
been expended in lawsuits, and sixty-three suits continued
actually pending against him in court; the legacies he bequeathed
amounted to eighty thousand florins.&nbsp; These, he saw, could
not be paid, should I claim nothing more than the paternal
inheritance; he, therefore, to render me unfortunate after his
death, craftily named me his universal heir, without mentioning
his father&rsquo;s will, but endeavoured, by his mysterious
death, and the following conditions, to enforce the execution of
his own will.</p>
<p>First,&mdash;I was to become a Catholic.</p>
<p>Secondly,&mdash;I was to serve only the house of Austria;
and,</p>
<p>Lastly,&mdash;He made his whole estate, without excepting the
paternal inheritance, a <i>Fidei commissum</i>.</p>
<p>Hence arose all my misfortunes, as indeed was his intention;
for, but a short time before his death, he said to the Governor,
Baron Kottulinsky, &ldquo;I shall now die contented, since I have
been able to trick my cousin, and render him wretched.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His death, believed in Vienna to be miraculous, happened after
the following manner; and by this he had induced many weak
people, who really believed him a saint, to further his
views.</p>
<p>Three days before his death, while in perfect health, he
desired the governor of the Spielberg would send for his
confessor, for that St. Francis had revealed to him he should be
removed into life everlasting on his birth-day at twelve
o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; The capuchin was sent for, but the
prediction laughed at.</p>
<p>The day, however, after the departure of his confessor, he
said, &ldquo;Praise be to God, my end approaches; my confessor is
dead, and has appeared to me.&rdquo;&nbsp; Strange as it may
seem; it was actually found to be true that the priest was
dead.&nbsp; He now had all the officers of the garrison of Brunn
assembled, tonsured his head like a capuchin, took the habit of
the order, publicly confessed himself in a sermon of an
hour&rsquo;s length, exhorted them all to holiness, acted the
part of a most exemplary penitent, embraced all present, spoke
with a smile of the insignificance of all earthly possessions,
took his leave, knelt down to prayers, slept calmly, rose, prayed
again, and about eleven in the forenoon, October 4th, taking his
watch in his hand, said, &ldquo;Thanks be to my God, my last hour
approaches.&rdquo;&nbsp; All laughed at such a farce from a man
of such a character; yet they remarked that the left side of his
face grew pale.&nbsp; He then leaned his arm on the table,
prayed, and remained motionless, with his eyes closed.&nbsp; The
clock struck twelve&mdash;no signs of life or motion could be
discovered; they spoke to him, and found he was really dead.</p>
<p>The word miracle was echoed through the whole country, and the
transmigration of the Pandour Trenck, from earth to heaven, by
St. Francis, proclaimed.&nbsp; The clue to this labyrinth of
miracles, known only to me, is truly as follows:&mdash;He
possessed the secret of what is called the <i>aqua tofana</i>,
and had determined on death.&nbsp; His confessor had been
entrusted with all his secrets, and with promissory notes, which
he wished to invalidate.&nbsp; I am perfectly certain that he had
returned a promissory note of a great prince, given for two
hundred thousand florins, which has never been brought to
account.&nbsp; The confessor, therefore, was to be provided for,
that Trenck might not be betrayed, and a dose of poison was given
him before he set off for Vienna: his death was the
consequence.&nbsp; He took similar means with himself, and thus
knew the hour of his exit; finding he could not become the first
on earth, he wished to be adored as a saint in heaven.&nbsp; He
knew he should work miracles when dead, because he ordered a
chapel to be built, willed a perpetual mass, and bequeathed the
capuchins sixty thousand florins.</p>
<p>Thus died this most extraordinary man, in the thirty-fourth
year of his age, to whom nature had denied none of her gifts; who
had been the scourge of Bavaria; the terror of France; and who
had, with his supposed contemptible pandours, taken above six
thousand Prussian prisoners.&nbsp; He lived a tyrant and enemy of
men, and died a sanctified impostor.</p>
<p>Such was the state of affairs, as willed by Trenck, when I
came to Vienna, in 1759, where I arrived with money and jewels to
the amount of twenty thousand florins.</p>
<p>Instead of profiting by the wealth Trenck had acquired, I
expended a hundred and twenty thousand florins of my own money,
including what devolved to me from my uncle, his father, in the
prosecution of his suits.&nbsp; Trenck had paid two hundred
ducats to the tribunal of Vienna, in the year 1743, to procure
its very reprehensible silence concerning a curator, to which I
was sacrificed, as the new judges of this court refused to
correct the error of their predecessors.&nbsp; Such are the
proceedings of courts of justice in Vienna!</p>
<p>On my first audience, no one could be received more kindly
than I was, by the Empress Queen.&nbsp; She spoke of my deceased
cousin with much emotion and esteem, promised me all grace and
favour, and informed me of the particular recommendations she had
received, on my behalf, from Count Bernes.&nbsp; Finding
sixty-three cases hang over my head, in consequence of the
inheritance of Trenck, to obtain justice in any one of which in
Vienna, would have employed the whole life of an honest man, I
determined to renounce this inheritance, and claim only under the
will and as the heir of my uncle.</p>
<p>With this view I applied for and obtained a copy of that will,
with which I personally appeared, and declared to the court that
I renounced the inheritance of Francis Trenck, would undertake
none of his suits, nor be responsible for his legacies, and
required only his father&rsquo;s estates, according to the legal
will, which I produced; that is to say, the three lordships of
Pakratz, Prestowacz, and Pleneritz, without chattels or personal
effects.&nbsp; Nothing could be more just or incontrovertible
than this claim.&nbsp; What was my astonishment, to be told, in
open court, that Her Majesty had declared I must either wholly
perform the articles of the will of Trenck, or be excluded the
entire inheritance, and have nothing further to hope.&nbsp; What
could be done?&nbsp; I ventured to remonstrate, but the will of
the court was determined and absolute: I must become a Roman
Catholic.</p>
<p>In this extremity I bribed a priest, who gave me a signed
attestation, &ldquo;That I had abjured the accursed heresy of
Lutheranism.&rdquo;&nbsp; My religion, however, remained what it
had ever been.&nbsp; General Bernes about this time returned from
his embassy, and I related to him the lamentable state in which I
found my affairs.&nbsp; He spoke to the Empress in my behalf, and
she promised everything.&nbsp; He advised me to have patience, to
perform all that was required of me, and to make myself
responsible for the depending suits.&nbsp; Some family concerns
obliged him, as he informed me, to make a journey to Turin, but
his return would be speedy: he would then take the management of
my affairs upon himself, and insure my good fortune in
Austria.&nbsp; Bernes loved me as his son, and I had reason to
hope, from his assurance, I should be largely remembered in his
will, which was the more probable, as he had neither child nor
relations.&nbsp; He parted from me, like a father, with tears in
his eyes; but he had scarcely been absent six weeks before the
news arrived of his death, which, if report may be credited, was
effected by poison, administered by <i>a friend</i>.&nbsp; Ever
the sport of fortune, thus were my supporters snatched from me at
the very moment they became most necessary.</p>
<p>The same year was I, likewise, deprived by death of my friend
and protector, Field-marshal Konigseck, Governor of Vienna, when
he had determined to interest himself in my behalf.&nbsp; I have
been beloved by the greatest men Austria ever produced, but
unfortunately have been persecuted by the chicanery of
pettifoggers, fools, fanatics, and priests, who have deprived me
of the favour of my Empress, guiltless as I was of crime or
deceit, and left my old age in poverty.</p>
<p>My ills were increased by a new accident.&nbsp; Soon after the
departure of Bernes, the Prussian minister, taking me aside, in
the house of the Palatine envoy, M. Becker, proposed my return to
Berlin, assured me the King had forgotten all that was past, was
convinced of my innocence, that my good fortune would there be
certain, and be pledged his honour to recover the inheritance of
Trenck.&nbsp; I answered, the favour came too late; I had
suffered injustice too flagrant, in my own country, and that I
would trust no prince on earth whose will might annihilate all
the rights of men.&nbsp; My good faith to the King had been too
ill repaid; my talents might gain me bread in any part of the
world, and I would not again subject myself to the danger of
unmerited imprisonment.</p>
<p>His persuasions were strong, but ineffectual.&nbsp; &ldquo;My
dear Trenck,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;God is my judge that my
intentions are honest; I will pledge myself, that my sovereign
will insure your fortune: you do not know Vienna; you will lose
all by the suits in which you are involved, and will be
persecuted because you do not carry a rosary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How often have I repented I did not then return to
Berlin!&nbsp; I should have escaped ten years&rsquo;
imprisonment; should have recovered the estates of Trenck: should
not have wasted the prime of life in the litigation of suits, and
the writing of memorials; and should have certainly been ranked
among the first men in my native country.&nbsp; Vienna was no
place for a man who could not fawn and flatter: yet here was I
destined to remain six-and-thirty years, unrewarded, unemployed;
and through youth and age, to continue on the list of invalid
majors.</p>
<p>Having rejected the proposition of the Prussian envoy, all my
hopes in Vienna were ruined; for Frederic, by his residents and
emissaries, knew how to effect whatever he pleased in foreign
courts, and determined that the Trenck who would no longer serve
or confide in him should at least find no opportunity of serving
against him: I soon became painted to the Empress as an arch
heretic who never would be faithful to the house of Austria, and
only endeavoured to obtain the inheritance of Trenck that he
might devote himself to Prussia.&nbsp; This I shall hereafter
prove; and display a scene that shall be the disgrace of many, by
whom the Empress was induced to harbour unjust suspicions of an
able and honest man.&nbsp; I here stand erect and confident
before the world; publish the truth, and take everlasting shame
to myself, if any man on earth can prove me guilty of one
treacherous thought.&nbsp; I owe no thanks; but so far from
having received favours, I have six and thirty years remained
unable to obtain justice, though I have all the while been
desirous of shedding my blood in defence of the monarchy where I
have thus been treated.&nbsp; Till the year 1746, I was equally
zealous and faithful to Prussia; yet my estates there, though
confiscated, were liable to recovery: in Hungary, on the
contrary, the sentence of confiscation is irrevocable.&nbsp; This
is a remarkable proof in favour of my honour, and my
children&rsquo;s claims.</p>
<p>Surely no reader will be offended at these digressions; my
mind is agitated, my feelings roused, remembering that my age and
grey hairs deprive me of the sweet hope of at length vanquishing
opposition, either by patience, or forcing justice, by eminent
services, or noble efforts.</p>
<p>This my history will never reach a monarch&rsquo;s eye,
consequently no monarch, by perceiving, will be induced to
protect truth.&nbsp; It may, indeed, be criticised by literati;
it will certainly be decried by my persecutors, who, through
life, have been my false accusers, and will probably, therefore,
be prohibited by the priests.&nbsp; All Germany, however, will
read, and posterity perhaps may pity, should my book escape the
misfortune of being classed among improbable romances; to which
it is the more liable, because that the biographers of Frederic
and Maria Theresa, for manifest reasons, have never so much as
mentioned the name of Trenck.</p>
<p>Once more to my story: I was now obliged to declare myself
heir, but always <i>cum reservatione juris mei</i>, not as simply
claiming under the will of Francis Trenck I was obliged to take
upon myself the management of the sixty-three suits, and the
expenses attending any one of these are well known in
Vienna.&nbsp; My situation may be imagined, when I inform the
reader I only received, from the whole estate of Trenck, 3,600
florins in three years, which were scarcely sufficient to defray
the expenses of new year&rsquo;s gifts to the solicitors and
masters in chancery.&nbsp; How did I labour in stating and
transcribing proofs for the court!&nbsp; The money I possessed
soon vanished.&nbsp; My Prussian relations supported me, and the
Countess Bestuchef sent me the four thousand roubles I had
refused at Petersburg.&nbsp; I had also remittances from my
faithful mistress in Prussia; and, in addition, was obliged to
borrow money at the usurious rate of sixty per cent.&nbsp;
Bewildered as I was among lawyers and knaves, my ambition still
prompted me to proceed, and all things are possible to labour and
perseverance; but my property was expended: and, at length, I
could only obtain that the contested estates should be made a
<i>Fidei commissum</i>, or put under trust; whereby, though they
were protected from being the further prey of others, I did not
inherit them as mine.&nbsp; In this pursuit was my prime of life
wasted, which might have been profitably and honourably
spent.</p>
<p>In three years, however, I brought my sixty-three suits to a
kind of conclusion; the probabilities were this could not have
been effected in fifty.&nbsp; Exclusive of my assiduity, the
means I took must not be told; it is sufficient that I here
learnt what judges were, and thus am enabled to describe them to
others.</p>
<p>For a few ducats, the president&rsquo;s servant used to admit
me into a closet where I could see everything as perfectly as if
I had myself been one of the council.&nbsp; This often was
useful, and taught me to prevent evil; and often was I scarcely
able to refrain bursting in upon this court.</p>
<p>Their appointed hour of meeting was nine in the morning, but
they seldom assembled before eleven.&nbsp; The president then
told his beads, and muttered his prayers.&nbsp; Someone got up
and harangued, while the remainder, in pairs, amused themselves
with talking instead of listening, after which the news of the
day became the common topic of conversation, and the council
broke up, the court being first adjourned some three weeks,
without coming to any determination.&nbsp; This was called
<i>judicium delegatum in causis Trenkiansis</i>; and when at last
they came to a conclusion, the sentence was such as I shall ever
shudder at and abhor.</p>
<p>The real estates of Trenck consisted in the great Sclavonian
manors, called the lordships of Pakratz, Prestowatz, and
Pleternitz, which he had inherited from his father, and were the
family property, together with Velika and Nustak, which he
himself had purchased: the annual income of these was 60,000
florins, and they contained more than two hundred villages and
hamlets.&nbsp; The laws of Hungary require&mdash;</p>
<p>1st.&nbsp; That those who purchase estates shall obtain the
<i>consensus regius</i> (royal consent).</p>
<p>2nd.&nbsp; That the seller shall possess, and make over the
right of property, together with that of transferring or
alienating, and</p>
<p>3dly.&nbsp; That the purchaser shall be a native born, or have
bought his naturalisation.</p>
<p>In default of all, or any of these, the Fiscus, on the death
of the purchaser, takes possession, repaying the <i>summa
emptitia</i>, or purchase-money, together within what can be
shown to have been laid out in improvements, or the <i>summa
inscriptitia</i>, the sum at which it stands rated in the fiscal
register.</p>
<p>Without form or notice, the Hungarian Fiscal President, Count
Grassalkowitz, took possession of all the Trenck estates on his
decease, in the name of the Fiscus.&nbsp; The prize was great,
not so much because of the estates themselves, as of the personal
property upon them.&nbsp; Trenck had sent loads of merchandise to
his estates, of linen, ingots of gold and silver from Bavaria,
Alsatia, and Silesia.&nbsp; He had a vast storehouse of arms, and
of saddles; also the great silver service of the Emperor Charles
VII., which he had brought from Munich, with the service of plate
of the King of Prussia; and the personal property on these
estates was affirmed considerably to exceed in value the estates
themselves.</p>
<p>I was not long since informed by one of the first generals,
whose honour is undoubted, that several waggons were laden with
these rich effects and sent to Mihalefze.&nbsp; His testimony was
indubitable; he knew the two pandours, who were the confidants of
Trenck, and the keepers of his treasures; and these, during the
general plunder, each seized a bag of pearls, and fled to Turkey,
where they became wealthy merchants.&nbsp; His rich stud of
horses were taken, and the very cows driven off the farms.&nbsp;
His stand of arms consisted of more than three thousand rare
pieces.&nbsp; Trenck had affirmed he had sent linen to the amount
of fifty thousand florins, in chests from Dunnhausen and
Cersdorf, in the county of Glatz, to his estates.&nbsp; The
pillage was general; and when orders came to send all the
property of Trenck and deliver it to his universal heir, nothing
remained that any person would accept.&nbsp; I have myself seen,
in a certain Hungarian nobleman&rsquo;s house, some valuable
arms, which I knew I had been robbed of! and I bought at Esseck
some silver plates on which were the arms of Prussia, that had
been sold by Counsellor D-n, who had been empowered to take
possession of these estates, and had thus rendered himself
rich.&nbsp; Of this I procured an attestation, and proved the
theft: I complained aloud at Vienna, but received an order from
the court to be silent, under pain of displeasure, and also to go
no more into Sclavonia.&nbsp; The principal reason of my loss of
the landed property in Hungary was my having dared to make
inquiries concerning the personal, not one guinea of which was
ever brought to account.&nbsp; I then proved my right to the
family estates, left by my uncle, beyond all dispute, and also of
those purchased by my cousin.&nbsp; The commissions appointed to
inquire into these rights even confirmed them; yet after they had
been thus established, I received the following order from the
court, in the hand of the Empress herself:&mdash;&ldquo;The
president, Count Grassalkowitz, takes it upon his conscience that
the Sclavonian estates do not descend to Trenck, <i>in
natura</i>; he must therefore receive the <i>summa emptitia et
inscriptitia</i>, together with the money he can show to have
been expended in improvements.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>
<p>And herewith ended my pleadings and my hopes.&nbsp; I had
sacrificed my property, laboured through sixty-three inferior
suits, and lost this great cause without a trial.&nbsp; I could
have remained satisfied with the loss of the personal property:
the booty of a soldier, like the wealth amassed by a minister,
appears to me little better than a public robbery; but the
acquirements of my ancestors, my birth-right by descent, of these
I could not be deprived without excessive cruelty.&nbsp; Oh
patience! patience!&mdash;Yet shall my children never become the
footmen, nor grooms, of those who have robbed them of their
inheritance; and to them I bequeathed my rights in all their
power: nor shall any man prevent my crying aloud, so long as
justice shall not be done.</p>
<p>The president, it is true, did not immediately possess himself
of the estates, but he took good care his friends should have
them at such rates that the sale of them did not bring the fiscal
treasury 150,000 florins, while I, in real and personal property,
lost a million and a half; nay, probably a sum equal to this in
personal property alone.</p>
<p>The summa <i>inscriptitia et emptitia</i> for all these great
estates only amounted to 149,000 florins, and this was to be paid
by the chamber, but the president thought proper to deduct 10,000
on pretence the cattle had been driven off the estate of Pakratz;
and, further, 36,000 more, under the shameful pretence that
Trenck, to recruit his pandours, had drained the estates of 3,600
vassals, who had never returned; the estates, therefore, must
make them good at the rate of thirty florins per head, which
would have amounted to 108,000 florins; but, with much
difficulty, this sum was reduced, as above stated, to 36,000
florins, each vassal reckoned at ten florins per head.&nbsp; Thus
was I obliged, from the property of my family, to pay for 3,600
men who had gloriously died in war, in defence of the contested
rights of the great Maria Theresa; who had raised so many
millions of contributions for her in the countries of her
enemies; who, sword in hand, had stormed and taken so many towns,
and dispersed, or taken prisoners, so many thousands of her
foes.&nbsp; Would this be believed by listening nations?</p>
<p>All deductions made for legacies, fees, and formalities, there
remained to me 63,000 florins, with which I purchased the
lordship of Zwerbach, and I was obliged to pay 6,000 florins for
my naturalisation.&nbsp; Thus, when the sums are enumerated which
I expended on the suits of Trenck, received from my friends at
Berlin and Petersburg, it will be found that I cannot, at least,
have been a gainer by having been made the universal heir of the
immensely rich Trenck.&nbsp; With regret I write these truths in
support of my children&rsquo;s claims, that they may not, in my
grave, reproach me for having neglected the duty of a father.</p>
<p>I will mere add a few particulars which may afford the reader
matter for meditation, cause him to commiserate my fate, and give
a picture of the manner in which the prosecution was carried on
against Trenck.</p>
<p>One Schygrai, a silly kind of beggarly baron, who was treated
as a buffoon, was invited in the year 1743 to dine with Baron
Pejaczewitz, when Trenck happened to be present.&nbsp; The
conversation happened to turn on a kind of brandy made in this
country, and Trenck jocularly said he annually distilled this
sort of brandy from cow-dung to the value of thirty thousand
florins.&nbsp; Schygrai supposed him serious, and wished to learn
the art, which Trenck promised to teach him Pejaczewitz told him
he could give him thirty thousand load of dung.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where shall I get the wood?&rdquo; said
Schygrai.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will give you thirty thousand
klafters,&rdquo; answered Trenck.&nbsp; The credulous baron,
thinking himself very fortunate, desired written promises, which
they gave him; and that of Trenck ran thus:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I hereby permit and empower Baron Schygrai
to sell gratis, in the forest of Tscherra Horra, thirty thousand
klafters of wood.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;Witness my hand,<br />
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Trenck</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Trenck was no sooner dead than the Baron brought his note, and
made application to the court.&nbsp; His attorney was the noted
Bussy, and the court decreed the estates of Trenck should pay at
the rate of one form thirty kreutzers per klafter, or forty-five
thousand florins, with all costs, and an order was given to the
administrators to pay the money.</p>
<p>Just at this time I arrived at Vienna, from Petersburg.&nbsp;
Doctor Berger, the advocate of Trenck, told me the affair would
admit of no delay.&nbsp; I hastened to the Empress, and obtained
an order to delay payment.&nbsp; An inquiry was instituted, and
this forest of Tscherra Horra was found to be situated in
Turkey.&nbsp; The absurdity and injustice were flagrant, and it
was revoked.&nbsp; I cannot say how much of these forty-five
thousand florins the Baron had promised to the noble judge and
the attorney.&nbsp; I only know that neither of them was
punished.&nbsp; Had not some holidays luckily intervened, or had
the attorney expected my arrival, the money would have been paid,
and an ineffectual attempt to obtain retribution would have been
the consequence, as happened in many similar instances.</p>
<p>I have before mentioned the advertisement inviting all who had
any demands or complaints against Trenck to appear, with the
promise of a ducat a day; and it is mere proper to add that the
sum of fifteen thousand florins was brought to account, and paid
out of the estates of Trenck.&nbsp; For this shameful purpose
some thousand of florins were paid besides to this species of
claimants and though, after examination, their pretensions all
proved to be futile, and themselves were cast in damages, yet was
none of this money ever refunded, or the false claimants
punished.&nbsp; Among these the pretended daughter of General
Schwerin received two thousand florins, notorious as was her
character.&nbsp; Again, Trenck was accused of having appropriated
the money to his own use, and treated as if convicted.&nbsp;
After his death a considerable demand was accordingly made.&nbsp;
I happening, however, to meet with Ruckhardt, his quarter-master,
he with asseverations declared that, instead of being indebted to
the regiment, the regiment was more than a hundred thousand
florins indebted to him, advised me to get attestations from the
captains, and assured me he himself would give in a clear
statement of the regiment&rsquo;s accounts.</p>
<p>I followed his advice, hastened to the regiment, and obtained
so many proofs, that the quarter-master of the regiment, who,
with the major, had in reality pocketed the money, was imprisoned
and put in irons.&nbsp; What became of the thief or the false
witness afterward I know not; I only know that nothing was
refunded, that the quarter-master found protectors, detained the
money, and, some years after this vile action, purchased a
commission.&nbsp; One instance more.</p>
<p>Trenck, to the corps of infantry he commanded, added a corps
of hussars, which he raised and provided with horses and
accoutrements sold by auction.&nbsp; My demand on this account
was upwards of sixty thousand florins, to which I received
neither money nor reply.&nbsp; He had also expended a hundred
thousand florins for the raising and equipping his three thousand
pandours; in consequence of which a signed agreement had been
given by the Government that these hundred thousand florins
should be repaid to his heir, or he, the heir, should receive the
command of the regiment.&nbsp; The regiment, however, at his
decease, was given to General Simschen; and as for the agreement,
care was taken it should never come into my hands.&nbsp; Thus
these hundred thousand florins were lost.</p>
<p>Yet it has been wickedly affirmed he was imprisoned in the
Spielberg for having embezzled the regiment&rsquo;s money;
whereas, I would to God I only was in possession of the sums he
expended on this regiment; for he considered the regiment as his
own; and great as was his avarice, still greater was his desire
of fame, and greater still his love for his Empress, for whom he
would gladly have yielded both property and life.</p>
<p>Within respect to the money that was to have been repaid for
improvement of the estates, I must add, these estates were bought
at a time when the country had been left desolate by the Turks,
and the reinstalment of such places as had fallen into their
hands, and the erecting of farmhouses, mills, stocking them with
horses, cattle, and seed corn, according to my poor estimate,
could not amount to less than eighty thousand florins; but I was
forbidden to go into Sclavonia, and the president offered, as an
indemnification, four thousand florins.&nbsp; Everybody was
astonished, but he, within the utmost coolness, told me I must
either accept this or nothing.&nbsp; The hearers of this sentence
cast their eyes up to heaven and pitied me.&nbsp; I remonstrated,
and thereby only made the matter worse.&nbsp; Grief and anxiety
occasioned me to take a journey into Italy, passing through
Venice, Rome, and Florence.</p>
<p>On my return to Vienna, I, by a friendly interference in
behalf of a woman whose fears rather than guilt had brought her
into danger, became suspected myself; and the very officious
officers of the police had me imprisoned as a coiner without the
least grounds for any such accusation except their own
surmises.&nbsp; I was detained unheard nine days, and when,
having been heard, I had entirely justified myself, was again
restored to liberty; public declaration was then made in the
Gazette that the officers of the police had acted too
precipitately.</p>
<p>This was the satisfaction granted, but this did not content
me.&nbsp; I threatened the counsellor by whom my character had
been so aspersed, and the Empress, condescending to mediate,
bestowed on me a captainship of cavalry in the Cordova
cuirassiers.</p>
<p>Such was the recompense I received for wounds so deep, and
such the neglect into which I was thrown at Vienna.&nbsp;
Discontent led me to join my regiment in Hungary.</p>
<p>Here I gained the applause of my colonel, Count Bettoni, who
himself told the Empress I, more than any other, had contributed
to the forming of the regiment.&nbsp; It may well be imagined how
a man like me, accustomed, as I had been, to the first company of
the first courts, must pass my time among the Carpathian
mountains, where neither society nor good books were to be found,
nor knowledge, of which I was enamoured, improved.&nbsp; The
conversation of Count Bettoni, and the chase, together with the
love of the general of the regiment, old Field-marshal Cordova,
were my only resources; the persecutions, neglect, and even
contempt, I received at Vienna, were still the same.</p>
<p>In the year 1754, in the month of March, my mother died in
Prussia, and I requested the permission of the court that held
the inheritance of Trenck, as a <i>fidei commissum</i>, to make a
journey to Dantzic to settle some family affairs with my brothers
and sister, my estates being confiscated.&nbsp; This permission
was granted, and thither I went in May, where I once more fell
into the hands of the Prussians; which forms the second great and
still more gloomy epoch in my life.&nbsp; All who read what
follows will shudder, will commiserate him who, feeling himself
innocent, relates afflictions he has miserably encountered and
gloriously overcome.</p>
<p>I left Hungary, where I was in garrison, for Dantzic, where I
had desired my brothers and sister to meet me that we might
settle our affairs.&nbsp; My principal intent, however, was a
journey to Petersburg, there to seek the advice and aid of my
friends, for law and persecution were not yet ended at Vienna;
and my captain&rsquo;s pay and small income scarcely sufficed to
defray charges of attorneys and counsellors.</p>
<p>It is here most worthy of remark that I was told by Prince
Ferdinand of Brunswick, governor of Magdeburg, he had received
orders to prepare my prison at Magdeburg before I set out from
Hungary.</p>
<p>Nay, more; it had been written from Vienna to Berlin that the
King must beware of Trenck, for that he would be at Dantzic at
the time when the King was to visit his camp in Prussia.</p>
<p>What thing more vile, what contrivance more abominable, could
the wickedest wretch on earth find to banish a man his country,
that he might securely enjoy the property of which the other had
been robbed?&nbsp; That this was done I have living witnesses in
his highness Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick and the Berlin
ministry, from whose mouths I learned this artifice of
villainy.&nbsp; It is the more necessary to establish this truth,
because no one can comprehend why the <i>Great Frederic</i>
should have proceeded against me in a manner so cruel that, when
it comes to be related, must raise the indignation of the just,
and move hearts of iron to commiserate.</p>
<p>Men so vile, so wicked, as I have described them, in
conjunction with one Weingarten, secretary to Count Puebla, then
Austrian minister at Berlin, have brought on me these my
misfortunes.</p>
<p>This was the Weingarten who, as is now well known, betrayed
all the secrets of the Austrian court to Frederic, who at length
was discovered in the year 1756, and who, when the war broke out,
remained in the service of Prussia.&nbsp; This same Weingarten,
also, not only caused my wretchedness, but my sister&rsquo;s ruin
and death, as he likewise did the punishment and death of three
innocent men, which will hereafter be shown.</p>
<p>It is an incontrovertible truth that I was betrayed and sold
by men in Vienna whose interest it was that I should be eternally
silenced.</p>
<p>I was immediately visited by my brothers and sister on my
arrival at Dantzic, where we lived happy in each other&rsquo;s
company during a fortnight, and an amicable partition was made of
my mother&rsquo;s effects; my sister perfectly justified herself
concerning the manner in which I was obliged to fly from her
house an the year 1746: our parting was kind, and as brother and
sister ought to part.</p>
<p>Our only acquaintance in Dantzic was the Austrian resident, M.
Abramson, to whom I brought letters of recommendation from
Vicuna, and whose reception of us was polite even to
extravagance.</p>
<p>This Abramson was a Prussian born, and had never seen Vienna,
but obtained his then office by the recommendation of Count
Bestuchef, without security for his good conduct, or proof of his
good morals, heart, or head.&nbsp; He was in close connection
with the Prussian resident, Reimer; and was made the instrument
of my ruin.</p>
<p>Scarcely had my brothers and sister departed before I
determined to make a voyage by sea to Russia.&nbsp; Abramson
contrived a thousand artifices, by which he detained me a week
longer in Dantzic, that, he in conjunction with Reimer, might
make the necessary preparations.</p>
<p>The King of Prussia had demanded that the magistrates of
Dantzic should deliver me up; but this could not be done without
offending the Imperial court, I being a commissioned officer in
that service, with proper passports; it was therefore probable
that this negotiation required letters should pass and repass;
and for this reason Abramson was employed to detain me some days
longer, till, by the last letters from Berlin, the magistrates of
Dantzic were induced to violate public safety and the laws of
nations.&nbsp; Abramson, I considered as my best friend, and my
person as in perfect security; he had therefore no difficulty in
persuading me to stay.</p>
<p>The day of supposed departure on board a Swedish ship for Riga
approached, and the deceitful Abramson promised me to send one of
his servants to the port to know the hour.&nbsp; At four in the
afternoon he told me he had himself spoken to the captain, who
said he would not sail till the next day; adding that he,
Abramson, would expect me to breakfast, and would then accompany
me to the vessel.&nbsp; I felt a secret inquietude which made me
desirous of leaving Dantzic, and immediately to send all my
luggage, and to sleep on board.&nbsp; Abramson prevented me,
dragging me almost forcibly along with him, telling me he had
much company, and that I must absolutely dine and sup at his
house; accordingly I did not return to my inn till eleven at
night.</p>
<p>I was but just in bed when I heard a tremendous knocking at my
chamber door, which was not shut, and two of the city magistrates
with twenty grenadiers entered my chamber, and surrounded my bed
so suddenly that I had not time to take to my arms and defend
myself.&nbsp; My three servants had been secured and I was told
that the most worthy magistracy of Dantzic was obliged to deliver
me up as a delinquent to his majesty the King of Prussia.</p>
<p>What were my feelings at seeing myself thus betrayed!&nbsp;
They silently conducted me to the city prison, where I remained
twenty-four hours.&nbsp; About noon Abramson came to visit me,
affected to be infinitely concerned and enraged, and affirmed he
had strongly protested against the illegality of this proceeding
to the magistracy, as I was actually in the Austrian service; but
that they had answered him the court of Vienna had afforded them
a precedent, for that, in 1742, they had done the same by the two
sons of the burgomaster Rutenberg, of Dantzic, and that,
therefore, they were justified in making reprisal; and likewise,
they durst not refuse the most earnest request accompanied with
threats, of the King of Prussia.</p>
<p>Their plea of retaliation originated as follows:&mdash;There
was a kind of club at Vienna, the members of which were seized
for having committed the utmost extravagance and debauchery, two
of whom were the sons of the burgomaster Rutenberg, and who were
sentenced to the pillory.&nbsp; Great sums were offered by the
father to avoid this public disgrace, but
ineffectually&mdash;they were punished, their punishment was
legal, and had no similarity whatever to my case, nor could it
any way justly give pretence of reprisal.</p>
<p>Abramson, who had in reality entered no protest whatever, but
rather excited the magistracy, and acted in concert with Reimer,
advised me to put my writings and other valuable effects into his
hands, otherwise they would be seized.&nbsp; He knew I had
received letters of exchange from my brothers and sister, about
seven thousand florins, and these I gave him, but kept my ring,
worth about four thousand, and some sixty guineas, which I had in
my purse.&nbsp; He then embraced me, declared nothing should be
neglected to effect my immediate deliverance; that even he would
raise the populace for that purpose; that I could not be given up
to the Prussians in less than a week, the magistracy being still
undetermined in an affair so serious, and he left me, shedding
abundance of crocodile tears, like the most affectionate of
friends.</p>
<p>The next night two magistrates, with their posse, came to my
prison, attended by resident Reimer, a Prussian officer and under
officers, and into their hands I was delivered.&nbsp; The pillage
instantly began; Reimer tore off my ring, seized my watch,
snuff-box, and all I had, not so much as sending me a coat or
shirt from my effects; after which, they put me into a close
coach with three Prussians.&nbsp; The Dantzic guard accompanied
the carriage to the city gate, that was opened to let me pass;
after which the Dantzic dragoons escorted me as far as Lauenburg
in Pomerania.</p>
<p>I have forgotten the date of this miserable day; but to the
best of my memory, it must have been in the beginning of
June.&nbsp; Thirty Prussian hussars, commanded by a lieutenant,
relieved the dragoons at Lauenburg, and thus was I escorted from
garrison to garrison, till I arrived at Berlin.</p>
<p>Hence it was evidently falsely affirmed, by the magistracy of
Dantzic, and the conspirator Abramson, who wrote in his own
excuse to Vienna, that my seizure must be attributed wholly to my
own imprudence, and that I had exposed myself to this arrest by
going without the city gates, where I was taken and carried off;
nor was it less astonishing that the court of Vienna should not
have demanded satisfaction for the treachery of the Dantzickers
toward an Austrian officer.&nbsp; I have incontrovertibly proved
this treachery, after I had regained my liberty Abramson indeed
they could not punish, for during my imprisonment he had quitted
the Austrian for the Prussian service, where he gradually became
so contemptible, that in the year 1764, when I was released from
my imprisonment, he was himself imprisoned in the house of
correction; and his wife, lately so rich, was obliged to beg her
bread.&nbsp; Thus have I generally lived to see the fall of my
betrayers; and thus have I found that, without indulging personal
revenge, virtue and fortitude must at length triumph over the
calumniator and the despot.</p>
<p>This truth will be further proved hereafter, nor can I behold,
unmoved, the open shame in which my persecutors live, and how
they tremble in my presence, their wicked deeds now being known
to the world Nay, monarchs may yet punish their
perfidy:&mdash;Yet not so!&mdash;May they rather die in
possession of wealth they have torn from me!&nbsp; I only wish
the pity and respect of the virtuous and the wise.</p>
<p>But, though Austria has never resented the affront commenced
on the person of an officer in its service, still have I a claim
on the city of Dantzic, where I was thus treacherously delivered
up, for the effects I there was robbed of, the amount of which is
between eleven and twelve thousand florins.&nbsp; This is a case
too clear to require argument, and the publication of this
history will make it known to the world.&nbsp; This claim also,
among others, I leave to the children of an unfortunate
father.</p>
<p>Enough of digression; let us attend to the remarkable events
which happened on the dismal journey to Berlin.&nbsp; I was
escorted from garrison to garrison, which were distant from each
other two, three, or at most five miles; wherever I came, I found
compassion and respect.&nbsp; The detachment of hussars only
attended me two days; it consisted of twelve men and an officer,
who rode with me in the carriage.</p>
<p>The fourth day I arrived at ---, where the Duke of Wirtemberg,
father of the present Grand Duchess of Russia, was commander, and
where his regiment was in quarters.&nbsp; The Duke conversed with
me, was much moved, invited me to dine, and detained me all the
day, where I was not treated as a prisoner.&nbsp; I so far gained
his esteem that I was allowed to remain there the next day; the
chief persons of the place were assembled, and the Duchess, whom
he had lately married, testified every mark of pity and
consideration.&nbsp; I dined with him also on the third day,
after which I departed in an open carriage, without escort,
attended only by a lieutenant of his regiment.</p>
<p>I must relate this, event circumstantially for it not only
proves the just and noble character of the Duke, but likewise
that there are moments in which the brave may appear cowards, the
clear-sighted blind, and the wise foolish; nay, one might almost
be led to conclude, from this, that my imprisonment at Magdeburg,
was the consequence of predestination, since I remained riveted
in stupor, in despite of suggestions, forebodings, and favourable
opportunities.&nbsp; Who but must be astonished, having read the
daring efforts I made at Glatz, at this strange insensibility now
in the very crisis of my fate?&nbsp; I afterwards was convinced
it was the intention of the noble-minded Duke that I should
escape, and that he must have given particular orders to the
successive officers.&nbsp; He would probably have willingly
subjected himself to the reprimands of Frederic if I would have
taken to fight.&nbsp; The journey through the places where his
regiment was stationed continued five days, and I everywhere
passed the evenings in the company of the officers, the kindness
of whom was unbounded I slept in their quarters without sentinel,
and travelled in their carriages, without other guard than a
single officer in the carriage.&nbsp; In various places the high
road was not more than two, and sometimes one mile from the
frontier road; therefore nothing could have been easier than to
have escaped; yet did the same Trenck, who in Glatz had cut his
way through thirty men to obtain his freedom, that Trenck, who
had never been acquainted with fear, now remain four days
bewildered, and unable to come to any determination.</p>
<p>In a small garrison town, I lodged in the house of a captain
of cavalry, and continually was treated by him with every mark of
friendship.&nbsp; After dinner he rode at the head of his
squadron to water the horse, unsaddled.&nbsp; I remained alone in
the house, entered the stable, saw three remaining horses, with
saddles and bridles; in my chamber was my sword and a pair of
pistols.&nbsp; I had but to mount one of the horses and fly to
the opposite gate.&nbsp; I meditated on the project, and almost
resolved to put it in execution, but presently became
undetermined by some secret impulse.&nbsp; The captain returned
some time after, and appeared surprised to find me still
there.&nbsp; The next day he accompanied me alone in his
carriage; we came to a forest, he saw some champignons, stopped,
asked me to alight, and help him to gather them; he strayed more
than a hundred paces from me, and gave me entire liberty to fly;
yet notwithstanding all this, I voluntarily returned, suffering
myself to be led like a sheep to the slaughter.</p>
<p>I was treated so well, during my stay at this place, and
escorted with so much negligence, that I fell into a gross
error.&nbsp; Perceiving they conveyed me straight to Berlin, I
imagined the King wished to question me concerning the plan
formed for the war, which was then on the point of breaking
out.&nbsp; This plan I perfectly knew, the secret correspondence
of Bestuchef having all passed through my hands, which
circumstance was much better known at Berlin than at
Vienna.&nbsp; Confirmed in this opinion, and far from imagining
the fate that awaited me, I remained irresolute, insensible, and
blind to danger.&nbsp; Alas, how short was this hope!&nbsp; How
quickly was it succeeded by despair! when, after four days&rsquo;
march, I quitted the district under the command of the Duke of
Wirtemberg, and was delivered up to the first garrison of
infantry at Coslin!&nbsp; The last of the Wirtemberg officers,
when taking leave of me, appeared to be greatly affected; and
from this moment till I came to Berlin, I was under a strong
escort, and the given orders were rigorously observed.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XV.</h2>
<p>Arrived here, I was lodged over the grand guardhouse, with two
sentinels in my chamber, and one at the door.&nbsp; The King was
at Potzdam, and here I remained three days; on the third, some
staff-officers made their appearance, seated themselves at a
table, and put the following questions to me:&mdash;</p>
<p>First.&nbsp; What was my business at Dantzic?</p>
<p>Secondly.&nbsp; Whether I was acquainted with M. Goltz,
Prussian ambassador to Russia?</p>
<p>Thirdly.&nbsp; Who was concerned with me in the conspiracy at
Dantzic?</p>
<p>When I perceived their intention, by these interrogations, I
absolutely refused to reply, only saying I had been imprisoned in
the fortress of Glatz, without hearing, or trial by
court-martial; that, availing myself of the laws of nature, I had
by my own exertions procured my liberty, and that I was now a
captain of cavalry in the imperial service; that I demanded a
legal trial for my first unknown offence, after which I engaged
to answer all interrogatories, and prove my innocence; but that
at present, being accused of new crimes, without a hearing
concerning my former punishment, the procedure was illegal.&nbsp;
I was told they had no orders concerning this, and I remained
dumb to all further questions.</p>
<p>They wrote some two hours, God knows what; a carriage came up;
I was strictly searched, to find whether I had any weapons;
thirteen or fourteen ducats, which I had concealed, were taken
from me, and I was conducted under a strong escort, through
Spandau to Magdeburg.&nbsp; The officer here delivered me to the
captain of the guard at the citadel; the town major came, and
brought me to the dungeon, expressly prepared for me; a small
picture of the Countess of Bestuchef, set with diamonds, which I
had kept concealed in my bosom, was now taken from me; the door
was shut, and here was I left.</p>
<p>My dungeon was in a casemate, the fore part of which, six feet
wide and ten feet long, was divided by a party wall.&nbsp; In the
inner wall were two doors, and a third at the entrance of the
casemate itself.&nbsp; The window in the seven-feet-thick wall
was so situated that, though I had light, I could see neither
heaven nor earth; I could only see the roof of the magazine;
within and without this window were iron bars, and in the space
between an iron grating, so close and so situated, by the rising
of the walls, that it was impossible I should see any parson
without the prison, or that any person should see me.&nbsp; On
the outside was a wooden palisade, six feet from the wall, by
which the sentinels were prevented from conveying anything to
me.&nbsp; I had a mattress, and a bedstead, but which was
immovably ironed to the floor, so that it was impossible I should
drag it, and stand up to the window; beside the door was a small
iron stove and a night table, in like manner fixed to the
floor.&nbsp; I was not yet put in irons, and my allowance was a
pound and a half per day of ammunition bread, and a jug of
water.</p>
<p>From my youth I had always had a good appetite, and my bread
was so mouldy I could scarcely at first eat the half of it.&nbsp;
This was the consequence of Major Reiding&rsquo;s avarice, who
endeavoured to profit even by this, so great was the number of
unfortunate prisoners; therefore, it is impossible I should
describe to my readers the excess of tortures that, during eleven
months, I felt from ravenous hunger.&nbsp; I could easily every
day have devoured six pounds of bread; and every twenty-four
hours after having received and swallowed my small portion, I
continued as hungry as before I began, yet must wait another
twenty-four hours for a new morsel.&nbsp; How willingly would I
have signed a bill of exchange for a thousand ducats, on my
property at Vienna, only to have satiated my hunger on dry
bread!&nbsp; For, so extreme was it, that scarcely had I dropt
into a sweet sleep.&nbsp; Therefore I dreamed I was feasting at
some table luxuriously loaded, where, eating like a glutton, the
whole company were astonished to see me, while my imagination was
heated by the sensation of famine.&nbsp; Awakened by the pains of
hunger, the dishes vanished, and nothing remained but the reality
of my distress; the cravings of nature were but inflamed, my
tortures prevented sleep, and, looking into futurity, the cruelty
of my fate suffered, if possible, increase, from imagining that
the prolongation of pangs like these was insupportable.&nbsp; God
preserve every honest man from sufferings like mine!&nbsp; They
were not to be endured by the villain most obdurate.&nbsp; Many
have fasted three days, many have suffered want for a week, or
more; but certainly no one, beside myself, ever endured it in the
same excess for eleven months.&nbsp; Some have supposed that to
eat little might become habitual, but I have experienced the
contrary.&nbsp; My hunger increased every day; and of all the
trials of fortitude my whole life has afforded, this, of eleven
months, was the most bitter.</p>
<p>Petitions, remonstrances, were of no avail; the answer
was&mdash;&ldquo;We must give no more, such is the King&rsquo;s
command.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Governor, General Borck, born the enemy
of man, replied, when I entreated, at least, to have my fill of
bread, &ldquo;You have feasted often enough out of the service of
plate taken from the King, by Trenck, at the battle of Sorau; you
must now eat ammunition bread in your dirty kennel.&nbsp; Your
Empress makes no allowance for your maintenance, and you are
unworthy of the bread you eat, or the trouble taken about
you.&rdquo;&nbsp; Judge, reader, what pangs such insolence, added
to such sufferings must inflict.&nbsp; Judge what were my
thoughts, foreseeing, as I did, an endless duration to this
imprisonment and these torments.</p>
<p>My three doors were kept ever shut, and I was left to such
meditations as such feelings and such hopes might inspire.&nbsp;
Daily, about noon, once in twenty-four hours, my pittance of
bread and water was brought.&nbsp; The keys of all the doors were
kept by the governor; the inner door was not opened, but my bread
and water were delivered through an aperture.&nbsp; The prison
doors were opened only once a week, on a Wednesday, when the
governor and town major, my hole having been first cleaned, paid
their visit.</p>
<p>Having remained thus two months, and observed this method was
invariable, I began to execute a project I had formed, of the
possibility of which I was convinced.</p>
<p>Where the night-table and stove stood, the floor was bricked,
and this paving extended to the wall that separated my casemate
from the adjoining one, in which was no prisoner.&nbsp; My window
was only guarded by a single sentinel; I therefore soon found,
among those who successively relieved guard, two kind-hearted
fellows, who described to me the situation of my prison; hence I
perceived I might effect my escape, could I but penetrate into
the adjoining casemate, the door of which was not shut.&nbsp;
Provided I had a friend and a boat waiting for me at the Elbe, or
could I swim across that river, the confines of Saxony were but a
mile distant.</p>
<p>To describe my plan at length would lead to prolixity, yet I
must enumerate some of its circumstances, as it was remarkably
intricate and of gigantic labour.</p>
<p>I worked through the iron, eighteen inches long, by which the
night-table was fastened, and broke off the clinchings of the
nails, but preserved their heads, that I might put them again in
their places, and all might appear secure to my weekly
visitors.&nbsp; This procured me tools to raise up the brick
floor, under which I found earth.&nbsp; My first attempt was to
work a hole through the wall, seven feet thick behind, and
concealed by the night-table.&nbsp; The first layer was of
brick.&nbsp; I afterwards came to large hewn stones.&nbsp; I
endeavoured accurately to number and remember the bricks, both of
the flooring and the wall, so that I might replace them and all
might appear safe.&nbsp; This having accomplished, I
proceeded.</p>
<p>The day preceding visitation all was carefully replaced, and
the intervening mortar as carefully preserved; the whole had,
probably, been whitewashed a hundred times; and, that I might
fill up all remaining interstices, I pounded the white stuff this
afforded, wetted it, made a brush of my hair, then applied this
plaster, washed it over, that the colour might be uniform, and
afterwards stripped myself, and sat with my naked body against
the place, by the heat of which it was dried.</p>
<p>While labouring, I placed the stones and bricks upon my
bedstead, and had they taken the precaution to come at any other
time in the week, the stated Wednesday excepted, I had inevitably
been discovered; but, as no such ill accident befell me, in six
months my Herculean labours gave me a prospect of success.</p>
<p>Means were to be found to remove the rubbish from my prison;
all of which, in a wall so thick, it was impossible to replace;
mortar and stone could not be removed.&nbsp; I therefore took the
earth, scattered it about my chamber, and ground it under my feet
the whole day, till I had reduced it to dust; this dust I strewed
in the aperture of my window, making use of the loosened
night-table to stand upon, I tied splinters from my bedstead
together, with the ravelled yarn of an old stocking, and to this
I affixed a tuft of my hair.&nbsp; I worked a large hole under
the middle grating, which could not be seen when standing on the
ground, and through this I pushed my dust with the tool I had
prepared in the outer window, then, waiting till the wind should
happen to rise, during the night I brushed it away, it was blown
off, and no appearance remained on the outside.&nbsp; By this
simple expedient I rid myself of at least three hundred weight of
earth, and thus made room to continue my labours; yet, this being
still insufficient, I had recourse to another artifice, which was
to knead up the earth in the form of sausages, to resemble the
human f&aelig;ces: these I dried, and when the prisoner came to
clean my dungeon, hastily tossed them into the night-table, and
thus disencumbered myself of a pound or two more of earth each
week.&nbsp; I further made little balls, and, when the sentinel
was walking, blew them, through a paper tube, out of the
window.&nbsp; Into the empty space I put my mortar and stones,
and worked on successfully.</p>
<p>I cannot, however, describe my difficulties after having
penetrated about two feet into the hewn stone.&nbsp; My tools
were the irons I had dug out, which fastened may bedstead and
night-table.&nbsp; A compassionate soldier also gave me an old
iron ramrod and a soldier&rsquo;s sheath knife, which did me
excellent service, more especially the latter, as I shall
presently more fully show.&nbsp; With these two I cut splinters
from my bedstead, which aided me to pick the mortar from the
interstices of the stone; yet the labour of penetrating through
this seven-feet wall was incredible; the building was ancient,
and the mortar occasionally quite petrified, so that the whole
stone was obliged to be reduced to dust.&nbsp; After continuing
my work unremittingly for six months, I at length approached the
accomplishment of my hopes, as I knew by coming to the facing of
brick, which now was only between me and the adjoining
casemate.</p>
<p>Meantime I found opportunity to speak to some of the
sentinels, among whom was an old grenadier called Gelfhardt, whom
I here name because he displayed qualities of the greatest and
most noble kind.&nbsp; From him I learned the precise situation
of my prison, and every circumstance that might best conduce to
my escape.</p>
<p>Nothing was wanting but money to buy a boat, and crossing the
Elbe with Gelfhardt, to take refuge in Saxony.&nbsp; By
Gelfhardt&rsquo;s means I became acquainted with a kind-hearted
girl, a Jewess, and a native of Dessau, Esther Heymannin by name,
and whose father had been ten years in prison.&nbsp; This good,
compassionate maiden, whom I had never seen, won over two other
grenadiers, who gave her an opportunity of speaking to me every
time they stood sentinel.&nbsp; By tying my splinters together, I
made a stick long enough to reach beyond the palisades that were
before my window, and thus obtained paper, another knife, and a
file.</p>
<p>I now wrote to my sister, the wife of the before-mentioned
only son of General Waldow; described my awful situation, and
entreated her to remit three hundred rix-dollars to the Jewess,
hoping, by this means, I might escape from my prison.&nbsp; I
then wrote another affecting letter to Count Puebla, the Austrian
ambassador at Berlin, in which was enclosed a draft for a
thousand florins on my effects at Vienna, desiring him to remit
these to the Jewess, having promised her that sum as a reward for
her fidelity.&nbsp; She was to bring the three hundred
rix-dollars my sister should send to me, and take measures with
the grenadiers to facilitate my flight, which nothing seemed able
to prevent, I having the power either to break into the casemate
or, aided by the grenadiers and the Jewess&rsquo; to cut the
locks from the doors and that way escape from my dungeon.&nbsp;
The letters were open, I being obliged to roll them round the
stick to convey them to Esther.</p>
<p>The faithful girl diligently proceeded to Berlin, where she
arrived safe, and immediately spoke to Count Puebla.&nbsp; The
Count gave her the kindest reception, received the letter, with
the letter of exchange, and bade her go and speak to Weingarten,
the secretary of the embassy, and act entirely as he should
direct.&nbsp; She was received by Weingarten in the most friendly
manner, who, by his questions, drew from her the whole secret,
and our intended plan of flight, aided by the two grenadiers, and
also that she had a letter for my sister, which she must carry to
Hammer, near Custrin.&nbsp; He asked to see this letter; read it,
told her to proceed on her Journey, gave her two ducats to bear
her expenses, ordered her to come to him on her return, said that
during this interval he would endeavour to obtain her the
thousand florins for my draft, and would then give her further
instructions.</p>
<p>Esther cheerfully departed for Hammer, where my sister, then a
widow, and no longer, as in 1746, in dread of her husband, joyful
to hear I was still living, immediately gave her three hundred
rix-dollars, exhorting her to exert every possible means to
obtain my deliverance.&nbsp; Esther hastened back with the letter
from my sister to Berlin, and told all that passed to Weingarten,
who read the letter, and inquired the names of the two
grenadiers.&nbsp; He told her the thousand florins from Vienna
were not yet come, but gave her twelve ducats; bade her hasten
back to Magdeburg, to carry me all this good news, and then
return to Berlin, where he would pay her the thousand
florins.&nbsp; Esther came to Magdeburg, went immediately to the
citadel, and, most luckily, met the wife of one of the
grenadiers, who told her that her husband and his comrade had
been taken and put in irons the day before.&nbsp; Esther had
quickness of perception, and suspected we had been betrayed; she
therefore instantly again began her travels, and happily came
safe to Dessau.</p>
<p>Here I must interrupt my narrative, that I may explain this
infernal enigma to my readers, an account of which I received
after I had obtained my freedom, and still possess, in the
handwriting of this Jewess.&nbsp; Weingarten, as was afterwards
discovered, was a traitor, and too much trusted by Count Puebla,
he being a spy in the pay of Prussia, and one who had revealed,
in the court of Berlin, not only the secrets of the Imperial
embassy, but also the whole plan of the projected war.&nbsp; For
this reason he afterwards, when war broke out, remained at Berlin
in the Prussian service.&nbsp; His reason for betraying me was
that he might secure the thousand florins which I had drawn for
on Vienna; for the receipt of the 24th of May, 1755, attests that
the sum was paid, by the administrators of my effects, to Count
Puebla, and has since been brought to account; nor can I believe
that Weingarten did not appropriate this sum to himself, since I
cannot be persuaded the ambassador would commit such an action,
although the receipt is in his handwriting, as may easily be
demonstrated, it being now in my possession.&nbsp; Thus did
Weingarten, that he might detain a thousand florins with
impunity, bring new evils upon me and upon my sister, which
occasioned her premature death; caused one grenadier to run the
gauntlet three successive days, and another to be hung.</p>
<p>Esther alone escaped, and since gave me an elucidation of the
whole affair.&nbsp; The report at Magdeburg was, that a Jewess
had obtained money from my sister and bribed two grenadiers, and
that one of these had trusted and been betrayed by his
comrade.&nbsp; Indeed, what other story could be told at
Magdeburg, or how could it be known I had been betrayed to the
Prussian ministry by the Imperial secretary?&nbsp; The truth,
however, is as I have stated: my account-book exists, and the
Jewess is still alive.</p>
<p>Her poor imprisoned father was punished with more than a
hundred blows to make him declare whether his daughter had
entrusted him with the plot, or if he knew whither she was fled,
and miserably died in fetters.&nbsp; Such was the mischief
occasioned by a rascal!&nbsp; And who might be blamed but the
imprudent Count Puebla?</p>
<p>In the year 1766, this said Jewess demanded of me a thousand
florins; and I wrote to Count Puebla, that, having his receipt
for the sum, which never had been repaid, I begged it might be
restored.&nbsp; He received my agent with rudeness, returned no
answer, and seemed to trouble himself little concerning my
loss.&nbsp; Whether the heirs of the Count be, or be not,
indebted to me these thousand florins and the interest, I leave
the world to determine.&nbsp; Thrice have I been betrayed at
Vienna and sold to Berlin, like Joseph to the Egyptians.&nbsp; My
history proves the origin of my persuasion that residents,
envoys, and ambassadors must be men of known worth and honesty,
and not the vilest of rascals and miscreants.&nbsp; But, alas!
the effects and money they have robbed me of have never been
restored; and for the miseries they have brought upon me, they
could not be recompensed by the wealth of any or all the monarchs
on earth.&nbsp; Estates they may, but truth they cannot
confiscate; and of the villainy of Abramson and Weingarten I have
documents and proofs that no court of justice could
disannul.&nbsp; Stop, reader, if thou hast a heart, and in that
heart compassion for the unfortunate!&nbsp; Stop and imagine what
my sensations are while I remember and recount a part only of the
injustice that has been done me, a part only of the tyranny I
have endured!&nbsp; By this last act of treachery of Weingarten
was I held in chains, the most horrible, for nine succeeding
years!&nbsp; By him was an innocent man brought to the
gallows!&nbsp; By him, too, my sister, my beloved, my unfortunate
sister, was obliged to build a dungeon at her own expense!
besides being amerced in a fine, the extent of which I never
could learn.&nbsp; Her goods were plundered, her estates made a
desert, her children fell into extreme poverty, and she herself
expired in her thirty-third year, the victim of cruelty,
persecution, her brother&rsquo;s misfortunes, and the treachery
of the Imperial embassy!</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
